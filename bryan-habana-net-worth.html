finest players of all time.</p><p>But is Bryan married, does he have kids and what is his <a href=#>net worth</a>?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2007-rugby-world-cup-final-844417439.jpg><h2>Who is Bryan Habana?</h2><p>Bryan Gary Habana was born on June 12, 1983, in Johannesburg, <a href=#>South Africa</a>.</p><p>He was reportedly named after <a href=#>Manchester United</a> footballers <a href=#>Bryan Robson</a> and Gary Bailey.</p><p>Before turning professional Bryan played in the positions of outside centre and scrum-half, but a vast improvement was seen in his game after he was moved to the wing.</p><p>He started his <a href=#>rugby union</a> club career in his hometown with the Golden Lions in 2003, before moving to Pretoria side the Blue Bells in 2005, winning Super Rugby titles in 2007 and again in 2009, during which year he also won a Currie Cup.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON RUGBY">READ MORE ON RUGBY</h2><p>Bryan then moved to the <a href=#>Cape Town</a> Stormers and Western Province in 2010, reaching the Super Rugby final at the first time of asking with the Stormers, but did not win the cup.</p><p>In 2012 he won another Currie Cup, but this time with Western Province.</p><p>In 2013 he moved to Toulon to join a star-studded line-up including <a href=#>Johnny Wilkinson</a>, Bakkies Botha, Matt Giteau, and Drew Mitchell among others, winning back-to-back European Rugby Champions Cups in 2014 and 2015, before retiring from the sport in 2018.</p><p>Habana made his international debut for <a href=#>South Africa</a> at the age of 21 in a test against <a href=#>England</a>, who were the current world champions, at <a href=#>Twickenham</a> in 2004.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby Union</h2></p><p>Although the Springboks lost the game 32-16, Habana came on as a reserve and scored a try with his first touch of the ball.</p><p>The following week he was elevated to the starting line-up against <a href=#>Scotland</a> at <a href=#>Murrayfield</a>, scoring two tries in a 45-10 victory.</p><p>From this most auspicious of beginnings, Bryan went on to become a pillar of his national side, competing in an impressive 124 tests and amassing a colossal 335 points.</p><p>Habana was 2007 Player of the Year as he equalled Jonah Lomu's record of eight tries to help South Africa win their second <a href=#>Rugby World Cup</a> in <a href=#>France</a>.</p><p>He was named the South African Rugby Player of the Year three times and is the second highest all-time test try scorer with 67.</p><p>Bryan was one of the fastest players in the history of the sport, clocking a 100 metre sprint time of 10.4 seconds — only 0.82 seconds behind <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a>'s world record of 9.58 seconds.</p><p>Such was his pace that in 2007 — before the Rugby World Cup in France — he raced a cheetah for charity to raise awareness about the critically endangered species.</p><p>Habana was given a 30-metre head start, but was pipped on the finish line by the seriously fast feline — Brian ran at 22mph, while the large cat reached 70mph.</p><p>Following the race he joked: "I guess I was very happy to see the cheetah pass me because then I know he wasn't looking at my rump."</p><p>Speaking about the key to success, Bryan told Sage: "I think success is down to each and every individual.</p><p>"For me, it is about being a better person and leaving this world in a better state than the one when I arrived in.</p><p>"An opportunity to give, where you make this world understand that one is better than zero, that you’re making one life better."</p><h2>Is Bryan Habana married and does the rugby star have children?</h2><p>Habana married his longterm girlfriend Janine in September 2009.</p><p>The couple have two children together.</p><p>Their first son, Timothy, was born in 2014, and their youngest, Gabriel, was born in 2018.</p><h2>What is Bryan Habana's net worth?</h2><p>Bryan's <a href=#>net worth</a> is reportedly around $5million (£4.1million).</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He made his money from a highly successful career as a professional rugby player, and since retiring has also worked as a commentator.</p><p>Habana is also a successful businessman, having co-founded financial wellness platform Paymenow, among other ventures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH91gJZpbGpvX5e%2Fuq3NZp%2BampGjrm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div
