The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, and fractured other teeth," the release read.</p><p>In another instance, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>CBS</a>, a correction officer was arrested for abusive sexual contact with an inmate at FCI Seagoville, the officer resigned and was sentenced to one year behind bars.&nbsp;</p><p>In another instance, the Bureau of Prisons and the Seagoville warden at the time were sued by an inmate over the conditions within the facility in a civil rights action.&nbsp;</p><p>In a complaint reviewed by The Sun, the inmate alleged that overcrowding exacerbated a number of conditions inmates faced inside the prison.&nbsp;</p><p>The inmate, Jed Lineberry, said the overcrowding added to an "increased&nbsp;<a href=#>exposure to a violent environment</a>," among a slew of other allegations in the federal filing.</p><p>His claims were ultimately dismissed since he had already been transferred to the Texarkana facility.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>JOSH'S SENTENCING</strong></h2><p>Honorable Judge Timothy L Brooks sentenced Josh to&nbsp;<a href=#>151 months in prison on May 25</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Sun's court reporter, Josh&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared stoic as he received his sentence</a>, which also includes $50,100 in fines.</p><p>As he read his decision, the judge called Josh's crimes "the sickest of the sick" to the packed courtroom.</p><p>He then said to Josh: "You have done some very bad things. But in your life as a whole, you've done good things... The true test of a man's character is what a man does when no one is watching."</p><p>Referring to Josh's insistence that he's innocent, the judge continued: "I find it aggravating about the lack of responsibility."</p><p>Judge Brooks recommended Josh participate in the Bureau of Prison's sex offender treatment program.</p><p>In the molestation police report, Jim Bob told authorities his son was sent to a Christian counseling program where he did “manual labor and had counseling.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>When prosecutors&nbsp;<a href=#>fought for a 20-year sentence</a>&nbsp;on the child pornography charges, they feared Josh would not get the proper counseling and would re-offend again.&nbsp;</p><p>The father of seven&nbsp;<a href=#>filed to appeal the sentence</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698492290-7.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000697144862-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000699184772-10.jpg><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network) at 800-656-HOPE (4673).</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYm2CcoWSaKGoq5hisbazxpqpZp6fp6%2BqsMOepWabn6O3trPApWSvoaOewbR5wKelmmWgp7a0u81o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjosh-duggar-forbidden-conjugal-visits-anna-prison.html&text=Josh%20Duggar%20is%20BANNED%20from%20conjugal%20visits%20with%20wife%20Anna%20as%20he%20serves%2012%20years%20behind%20bars%20in%20Texas&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjosh-duggar-forbidden-conjugal-visits-anna-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-duggar-forbidden-conjugal-visits-anna-prison.html&title=Josh%20Duggar%20is%20BANNED%20from%20conjugal%20visits%20with%20wife%20Anna%20as%20he%20serves%2012%20years%20behind%20bars%20in%20Texas" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjosh-duggar-forbidden-conjugal-visits-anna-prison.html&title=Josh%20Duggar%20is%20BANNED%20from%20conjugal%20visits%20with%20wife%20Anna%20as%20he%20serves%2012%20years%20behind%20bars%20in%20Texas" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-duggar-forbidden-conjugal-visits-anna-prison.html&title=Josh%20Duggar%20is%20BANNED%20from%20conjugal%20visits%20with%20wife%20Anna%20as%20he%20serves%2012%20years%20behind%20bars%20in%20Texas" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjosh-duggar-forbidden-conjugal-visits-anna-prison.html&description=Josh%20Duggar%20is%20BANNED%20from%20conjugal%20visits%20with%20wife%20Anna%20as%20he%20serves%2012%20years%20behind%20bars%20in%20Texas" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./selling-the-ocs-jarvis-and-austin-feud-about-swinger-comment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Selling the OC's Jarvis and Austin Feud About 'Swinger' Comment">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maria-dowbor-baczynska.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Maria DowborBaczyska net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
