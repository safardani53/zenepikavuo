But a run-in with Celtic captain Scott Brown was the catalyst for a<br>war with Kelbie.</p><p>Richardson attacked former boyhood pal Brown outside Citrus nightclub in 2009.</p><p>That prompted Brown’s friend Kelbie, 31, to hunt down Richardson — who was no<br>match for the ex-boxer.</p><p>Weeks later, Richardson was arrested following a two-year police probe into<br>his gang, which peddled 75 per cent of Edinburgh’s coke.</p><p>As he began a 10-year sentence, his brother Dale Richardson was allegedly<br>attacked by Kelbie in a club.</p><p>Days later, a gunman blasted Kelbie in the back outside Bannatyne’s gym.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2247440.main_image.jpg><p>The next day, Richardson’s drug-dealer dad Mark Sr was attacked by a mob<br>wielding baseball bats — killing the family’s pet dog.</p><p>Kelbie was then arrested for allegedly spitting in the face of Richardson’s<br>hairdresser girlfriend Stephanie Dignan, daughter of millionaire Steven<br>Dignan. When Richardson’s prison sentence was reduced on appeal, Kelbie<br>branded him a “grass” on Facebook.</p><p>In February 2012, Dignan crony Gordon Archibald was slashed ¬— but suspected<br>knifeman James “Jasper” McCann walked free.</p><p>Months later Richardson, right, was slashed in Glenochil jail by an associate<br>who had been threatened with violence to carry out the attack.</p><p>In November 2013, a masked gunman used an AK47 to unleash a volley of shots on<br>Kelbie’s home. Earlier this year, one of Kelbie’s relatives was also slashed<br>behind bars.</p><p>And now Richardson is back on the streets.</p><p>A washed-up ex-Hibs casual in the boxing scene failed to broker a truce.</p><p>So far there have been no convictions for any of the tit-for-tat violence as<br>neither side will speak to cops.</p><p>A source said: “It’s been going on for over five years, causing serious damage<br>to a lot of people. There’s too much bad blood. People are watching and<br>waiting.”</p><h2>Daniels v Somalis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2247431.main_image.jpg><p>SOMALI gangsters hit the headlines when crack dealer Mohammed Abdi was hunted down and shot dead in Edinburgh.</p><p>Hussein Ali, 26, Mohamud Mohamud, 30, and Cadil Huseen, 23, were each jailed for at least 25 years for the 2013 murder.</p><p>Abdi’s machine-gun slaying in the capital’s Duddingston area revealed the extreme violence between rival Somali crooks.</p><p>But we can reveal that they have also clashed with native Scottish gangsters.</p><p>The Scottish Sun has spoken to a gang member who described how his mob went up against Glasgow’s Daniel crime clan. And when they began to sell crack in the Daniel mob’s Possil heartland, violence flared.</p><p>Depending on who to believe, either the Somalis backed down or they did a deal with the rival gang, led by scrapyard boss Jamie Daniel, 57.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2247438.main_image.jpg><p>The Somali said: “There were a few shootings but no one got badly hurt.</p><p>“We ended up sitting down with them and agreeing that we would only deal crack while the white boys stuck to brown (heroin) and pills (ecstasy).”</p><p>But a source close to the Daniels said: “The Somalis aren’t in this area now because they were getting too much heat from the young Daniel boys.</p><p>“Guns are not the sole preserve of Somalis and they must have realised there were easier places for them to deal in.”</p><p>In Canada — which has 50 unsolved Somali gang killings — cops believe colleagues here need to reach out to young Africans.</p><p>Sgt Christopher Laush, who heads a unit battling gangs in Toronto, said: “Scottish and Somali gangs might hate each other but when it comes to making money, they will work together.”</p><h2>Boyd v Rennie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2247434.main_image.jpg><p>IF criminal nicknames are supposed to inspire fear, Stewart ‘Specky’ Boyd and his gang — Robert ‘Piggy’ Pickett, George ‘Goofy’ Docherty and Stewart Gillespie — should have had a re-think.</p><p>But Boyd was in fact one of the most dangerous criminals in Scotland’s history.</p><p>And his war against the Rennie family in Paisley in the 1990s claimed many lives and contaminated local politics.</p><p>Boyd’s gang was linked to a security firm in the town’s Ferguslie Park which was backed with almost £200,000 of taxpayers’ money and had Labour Party figures on its board.</p><p>In November 1995, three Rennie brothers received a visit from Gillespie,<br>Pickett and Docherty. Gillespie pointed at one and told Pickett to “shoot the fat b******” — but the gun was a dud.</p><p>Soon after a bloodbath ensued and all three Rennies were almost killed in the violence.</p><p>In May 1996, 26-year-old Mark Rennie was shot in the back as he tried to run away.</p><p>His attackers stood laughing over him as he lay dying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2247443.main_image.jpg><p>Gillespie, 37, was jailed for the murder and the three attempted murders six months earlier. Alongside him in the dock were Pickett, 31, and Docherty,<br>36, who were also convicted for the earlier attacks on the three brothers.</p><p>Pickett got 12 years while Docherty got seven.</p><p>Intimidation surrounding the trial led to the creation of Scotland’s first witness protection unit.</p><p>Missing from the dock was Boyd who’d done a runner to Spain. He returned and stood trial for murder the following year but was cleared.</p><p>Meanwhile, then MP Irene Adams accused the security firm of being a protection racket and front for drug dealing and money laundering.</p><p>There were few tears shed at the demise of Boyd, Docherty and Gillespie. Boyd died in a car crash in Spain in 2003, Docherty was run down and murdered by a mob in 2006 and Gillespie was stabbed to death in 2012.</p><p>Pickett was shot in 2006 after he joined forces with the Lyons as they waged war with the Daniels. Boyd was later linked to nine unsolved murders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfan14fpdomaWnn5l6sLqMrZ%2BeZaOpv6ax06xm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fblood-on-the-streets.html&text=Scotlands%20gangs%20%20Blood%20on%20the%20streets%20%20The%20Sun&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fblood-on-the-streets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fblood-on-the-streets.html&title=Scotlands%20gangs%20%20Blood%20on%20the%20streets%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fblood-on-the-streets.html&title=Scotlands%20gangs%20%20Blood%20on%20the%20streets%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fblood-on-the-streets.html&title=Scotlands%20gangs%20%20Blood%20on%20the%20streets%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fblood-on-the-streets.html&description=Scotlands%20gangs%20%20Blood%20on%20the%20streets%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shannon-sharpe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shannon Sharpe: NFL &amp;amp; Controversies [2023 Update]">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./robert-pattinson-and-kristen-stewart-fought-about-her-affair-jay-z-says-beyonce-is-not-pregnant-top-5-stories-2013205.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart Fought About Her Affair: Top 5 Stories">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
