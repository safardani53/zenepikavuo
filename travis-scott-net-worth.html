According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>, plaintiff Kristian Paredes filed a civil suit against Travis and Drake, blaming the two stars for purposely inciting "a riot and violence."</p><p>The lawsuit further states that Travis "had incited mayhem and chaos at prior events" and that the proper steps to prevent or mitigate that behavior, such as having enough security and medical professionals/equipment on site, were not taken. On Drake's end, the plaintiff claimed that the rapper "helped incite the crowd even though he knew of [Travis's] prior conduct," and added that he "continued to perform on stage while the crowd mayhem continued."</p><p>Kristian's representatives said that he was at the front of the crowd when it "became chaotic and a stampede began." As a result, he "suffered severe bodily injuries" that "had a serious effect on the plaintiff's health and well-being." His is not the only case to emerge from the event so far either, as two other plaintiffs are also reportedly seeking $1 million each in damages for what happened to them at the festival.</p><p>As of now, neither Travis nor Drake have commented on the lawsuits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2BiwsisZKybn6nBbrrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftravis-scott-net-worth.html&text=What%20Is%20Travis%20Scott%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Details%20on%20His%20Finances&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-scott-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-scott-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Travis%20Scott%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Details%20on%20His%20Finances" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftravis-scott-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Travis%20Scott%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Details%20on%20His%20Finances" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-scott-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Travis%20Scott%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Details%20on%20His%20Finances" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-scott-net-worth.html&description=What%20Is%20Travis%20Scott%27s%20Net%20Worth%3f%20Details%20on%20His%20Finances" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./henry-winkler-wife-barry-stacey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Henry Winkler married to?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./teen-mom-jade-cline-plastic-surgeon-under-investigation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Teen Mom Jade Cline's plastic surgeon under investigation for 'ignoring patient who bled &amp;amp; went into">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
