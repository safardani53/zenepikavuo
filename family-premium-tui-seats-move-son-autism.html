Billy worked himself up so much he was nearly sick.&nbsp;</p><p>"After another 30 minutes, the buggy was finally there and I put Billy in and he instantly felt better."</p><p>Amanda said her group filed a complaint over the way they were treated but were disappointed by the lack of quick response.</p><p>TUI claims it never received this, but the family eventually received an email thanking them for raising the issues and apologising for the "level of service" they received.</p><p>A spokesperson for <a href=#>TUI</a> said: "We take allegations of this nature very seriously.</p><h2

is nonverbal autism?</h3></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;(ASD) is an incurable, lifelong developmental condition that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others.</p><p>It affects around one in 100 people in the UK and is three to four times more common in boys than in girls.</p><p>Many people with ASD find it hard to understand other people's feelings and emotions, and they may have difficulty holding conversations.</p><p>When they are young, their language development may take longer and they can struggle to use facial expressions, using gestures to communicate instead.</p><p>They may also find it hard to connect with other people and to hold eye contact with unfamiliar individuals.</p><p>Many children with ASD like to follow a routine, and changes to this can cause distress.</p><p>High functioning autism is an informal term some people use to describe those on the autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>Nonverbal, or non-speaking, autism is a subset of autism where the person does not learn how to speak, and sometimes not point or gesture.</p><img
