He was diagnosed with signet-cell colon cancer, a rare type of illness that affects fewer than 1% of patients. It is often not discovered early enough to allow for recovery.&nbsp;He said that chemotherapy “made it difficult for me to perform concerts,” and that he also had deadened nerves in his fingers and hands. He stated:</p><p>“Chemotherapy has been a constant in my life since my first diagnosis and surgery in September of last year. It has enabled me to maintain a respectable standard of living. I’m thankful for it, as well as the excellent local health care I’ve gotten, as well as the endless support of my wife, family, and friends.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kim-Simmonds.jpg alt="Kim Simmonds" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Kim Simmonds established Savoy Brown in 1965.</h2><p>Kim Simmonds, who was born on December 5, 1947, began his career as a member of Savoy Brown. He founded the band in 1965 and played on a number of occasions. Despite the fact that the lineup changed throughout the years, Simmonds, along with Pat DeSalvo and Garnet Grimm, stayed in the primary lineup until his death.&nbsp;Shake Down, Savoy Brown’s debut studio album was released in 1967 and got great reviews from reviewers and audiences. The band proceeded to release albums such as Getting to the Point, Blue Matter, A Step Further, Looking In, Hellbound Train, and more, as well as singles such as I’m Tired, Tell Mama, and Run to Me.</p><p>The group rose to prominence with the publication of its fifth album, Raw Sienna, in April 1970. The album debuted at the top of the US Billboard 200 and CAN RPM charts. Hellbound Train, their ninth album, is famous for its hits. The album, which was released in February 1972, had eight singles that were well-received by the public.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kim-Simmonds-2.jpg alt="Kim Simmonds" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Taking the Blues Back Home: Live in America, Savoy Brown’s most recent CD, was published in 2020. Kim Simmonds appeared in the 2008 rockumentary American Music: Off the Record, with a slew of other artists and musical groups.&nbsp;Simmonds had a solo career in addition to his work with Savoy Brown, during which he published five albums. Solitaire, his first solo album, was released in 1997, followed by Blues Like Midnight in 2001. Struck By Lightning in 2004, Out of the Blue in 2008, and Jazzin’ on the Blues in 2015 followed.&nbsp;Kim Simmonds’ wife and family members survive him.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqVdqLauuc6nm6xloJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxwbGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkim-simmonds-passed-away-at-the-age-of-75.html&text=Kim%20Simmonds%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2075&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-simmonds-passed-away-at-the-age-of-75.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-simmonds-passed-away-at-the-age-of-75.html&title=Kim%20Simmonds%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2075" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkim-simmonds-passed-away-at-the-age-of-75.html&title=Kim%20Simmonds%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2075" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkim-simmonds-passed-away-at-the-age-of-75.html&title=Kim%20Simmonds%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2075" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-simmonds-passed-away-at-the-age-of-75.html&description=Kim%20Simmonds%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2075" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./natalie-portman-and-julianne-moores-may-december-film-what-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore's 'May December' Film: What to Know">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ice-t-shares-details-of-his-las-vegas-wedding-to-coco-austin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ice-T Shares Details of His Las Vegas Wedding to Coco Austin  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
