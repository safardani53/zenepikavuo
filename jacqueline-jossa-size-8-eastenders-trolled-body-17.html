I used to, back in the day.</p><p>"Ten years ago I would care about my appearance and it would get in my head. I’d think ‘they're right, I need to lose weight, I need to do this or that’. I don’t think like that anymore.</p><p>"I don’t know if it’s age, since having little girls who look up to me, or from being a bit more honest on social media, it’s like a weight lifted.</p><p>"You feel ‘I don’t need to be a size 8’. I can be happy with how I look. Ultimately when I’m naked and in sexy underwear, I feel a 10/10."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000656603718.jpg><p>Jacqueline, who said she was a size 12 last September, <a href=#>went on a weight loss regime</a> earlier this year and shed 8lb.</p><p>She starred on EastEnders for eight years, going on to be crowned Queen of the Jungle in 2019, after leaving the soap.</p><p>In 2017, she married former Towie star Dan Osborne, 30, with whom she has daughters Ella, six, and Mia, three. Dan also shares custody of his son Teddy, seven.</p><p>The family live in a <a href=#>£1.2 million six-bed pad</a> in Essex - which they are renovating to turn into their dream home - but Jacqueline insists she's still just as down to Earth as the teen who joined the soap.</p><p>You feel ‘I don’t need to be a size 8’. I can be happy with how I look. Ultimately when I’m naked and in sexy underwear, I feel a 10/10</p><span class=quote-credit>Jacqueline Jossa</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>28</span><p>She says: "I get an amazing response on social media. Sometimes I get told off for saying things which aren’t 'celebrity like'. But I think people relate to me because I’m probably too normal.</p><p>"I’ve unfollowed people (on social media) who make me feel bad about myself. It’s not necessarily that they’re doing anything wrong, it’s just about how I feel.</p><p>"I follow really positive people - and that’s what I want to be for other people."</p><h2>CHILD STAR FAME</h2><p>Jacqueline joined the EastEnders in 2010, replacing Madeline Duggan. She says: "I don’t think I was made for the celebrity life. People forget that I never once asked to be a celebrity.</p><p>"I was 17 when I got the job of being in EastEnders, and that was because I wanted to be an actress more than anything in life.</p><p>"It wasn’t for the money. It didn’t even dawn on me I would ever get recognised.</p><p>"I didn’t think of fame, I just thought ‘I’m going to meet Kat Slater and June Brown’. I was just so excited, like ‘oh my God I’m going to be in EastEnders’.</p><p>"I was on it for eight years, so the following and everything else just came with it. I’ve always remained really grounded.</p><p>"Even when I was in the Jungle, I was starstruck of every f***ing person in there. I’d look to my left, Ian Wright, look to my right, Caitlin Jenner.</p><p>"I was very lucky to be there. I don’t see myself like that. And I know everyone says that, but I actually don’t."</p><p>She adds of her pre-EastEnders days: "I was so naive, it’s cute when I think back to that time, I’m like ‘bless me’, that little girl just starting out.</p><p>"It only dawned on me when a press release came out about me joining.</p><p>"I think I had a bit of a bad start as a re-casting, everyone’s got an opinion straight away and everyone’s negative because people in this country don’t like change, which I get.</p><p>"They released a picture of me saying I was a re-cast and I read these forums and the comment section of Mail Online and was like ‘oh wow’.</p><p>I was a size 8 and honestly thought I was so fat, because of the response of people on one picture, I hadn’t even made it onto telly yet</p><span class=quote-credit>Jac Jossa</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>28</span><p>"I was a size 8 and honestly thought I was so fat, because of the response of people on one picture, I hadn’t even made it onto telly yet.</p><p>"It was probably the first time I’d faced criticism. No-one comes up to you and tells you negative things to your face, ever really. So it hit me all at once.</p><p>"At 17 as well, when you’re really vulnerable and learning things about yourself, your body, who you are.</p><p>"Then you have to grow up in front of paparazzi as well, this weird stuff that’s all new to you.</p><p>"It’s a very strange time but I’ll be honest, I dealt quite well with it. I loved to be on EastEnders more than I cared about any of that, it was just the best job ever."</p><h2>MILLION POUND FASHION EMPIRE</h2><p>It's her newfound body confidence, and her desire to give the same to other women, which drives Jacqueline with her In The Style fashion ranges.</p><p>When she launched her first line in February last year, <a href=#>the actress broke records as In The Style's fastest-selling range</a> - with items disappearing in six minutes and fans spending £250,000 in an HOUR.</p><p>She says: "I absolutely love In The Style but I was so nervous at the beginning. I said to Adam ‘are you sure?’</p><p>"Before the Jungle, I’d never really done a clothes ad. I said ‘I don’t know if people will buy what I wear’. I felt like it was a risk, it could have flopped and I didn’t have anything to compare it to.</p><p>"So it was scary, I felt vulnerable and didn’t know whether I would feel uncomfortable. But it went really, really well.</p><p>"When we had our first meeting, I was a bit unsure. Then I was like ‘actually yeah, that’s what we need to do, make things for normal women like me who struggle a bit’.</p><p>"Bodycon isn’t my thing anymore, neither is too much boob.</p><p>"So I said 'can we make clothes that I can actually f***ing wear? Can we make clothes that I can wear a bra with? That’d be cute. Can we make clothes that I feel comfortable in and can sit down in?’</p><p>"That’s why I think it’s done really well because I think there was a gap for that. It’s been a year now and it’s still going strong, it’s really good."</p><p>At first, Jacqueline avoided temptation to follow in the footsteps of Billie Faiers and Charlotte Crosby, with an In The Style swimwear collection.</p><p>But she <a href=#>faced her nerves head on</a> and launched her own bikini line this summer - to equal sell-out success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000657064521.jpg><p>She tells us: "I’m comfortable in a bikini if it’s how I want to wear it. I like a high-waisted cut and it has to be flattering.</p><p>"I was nervous because we always do videos as well. I feel super comfortable in all the dresses, so the line sells itself.</p><p>"I was worried if I didn’t feel comfortable in (my swimwear), my audience were going to know. If I’m not feeling myself, I get messages (on social media) saying ‘are you OK?’</p><p>"They know me really well and they trust what I’m saying so I was thinking ‘oh I hope I do feel like a 10/10’.</p><p>"Then I had the hair and make-up on and it was a beautiful sunny day (for the shoot). I looked in the mirror and was like ‘yeah I look good!’ I was so excited, I felt so confident, I just loved it.</p><p>"I said to Adam (Frisby, In The Style's founder) ‘we should do more’. He said ‘you only wanted to do three’ and I said ‘we should do more’."</p><p>Although Jacqueline's down-to-earth attitude is a hit with her fans, she still falls victim to the trolling she endured as a teenager, with the keyboard warriors now turning to her kids.</p><p><a href=#>Jacqueline previously revealed the extent of the abuse on her stories</a>, admitting some called her "brain dead", "a silly cow" or claimed her kids are "clearly disabled".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000672322331-1.jpg><p>She says: "If I read a comment that’s about my kids, it definitely affects me more than it would if it’s about me. But it’s not like there’s loads of comments.</p><p>"I get so much more positive, lovely feedback, but when it’s about my kids it doesn’t sit well with me.</p><p>"My kids are amazing, they know that, I know that. I wouldn’t allow what other people think about me to affect me mentally.</p><p>"I’ve got a really amazing unit of people around me. I’ve got an amazing bunch of friends and family, so I’m really lucky, I don’t have much to moan about."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000672804401.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Jac's Superdrug heroes</h3></p><p>Solait Anti-ageing Face Sun Cream SPF50+Very High 50ml, £3.99 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></p><p>BPerfect X Jac Jossa Hydro Glo Tanning Facial Mist 150ml, £12.95 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">buy here</a></p><p>B.
