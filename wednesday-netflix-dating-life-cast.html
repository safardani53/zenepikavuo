From cinematography to Jenna Ortega’s performance as the titular character —&nbsp; the show has been critically acclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>Wednesday had the second-most <a href=# rel=noopener>pre-release</a> viewers of any Netflix original series on the site, behind The Witcher. It eventually premiered at number one on Netflix in 83 countries.&nbsp;</p><p>With 341.2 million hours seen in its first week of release, the series surpassed the previous record holder <a href=#>Stranger Things 4</a>‘s 335.01 million hours to claim the record for the most hours watched in a week for an English-language Netflix series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bio and dating life of Wednesday’s cast</h2><p>With many eyes on the show, people have also been curious about the cast. Mostly, they have been curious about the members’ bio, age, dating life, and partner.</p><p>Here is everything we know about them.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Jenna Ortega</h3><p>Ortega was born in the United States on September 27, 2002, making her age 20 as of 2022. She began acting as a kid when she was young, winning praise for her portrayal of little Jane in the comedy-drama Jane the Virgin on The CW.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, she was critically acclaimed for her role as Harley Diaz in the Disney Channel series Stuck in the Middle. Currently, Ortega has established herself as a scream queen after appearing in movies like Scream, X, and Studio 666.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Talking about her dating life, the star seems to be single right now. When she and Asher Angel attended a Halloween costume party together in 2018, it gave rise to dating rumors.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she hasn’t mentioned anybody else since. Naturally, many of Wednesday‘s admirers have loved speculating about a prospective romance with her co-star Percy Hynes-White.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the two haven’t given us any signs of a romantic relationship.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Luis Guzmán</h3><p>Puerto Rican Actor, Luis Guzmán, was born in Puerto Rico on August 28, 1956. At the time of writing, his age is 66.&nbsp;</p><p>Guzmán’s filmography and bio are very interesting since his nearly 40-year career has included a lot of movies and television shows. He has acted in the films like Out of Sight (1998), The Limey (1999), and Traffic, as well as the Paul Thomas Anderson films Boogie Nights (1997), Magnolia (1999), and Punch-Drunk Love (2002).&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in The Limey. On Wednesday, he played the role of the patriarch of the Addams Family, Gomez Addams.</p><p>Guzmán is a private persona and has not talked about his personal life. However, it is reported that he is happily married to his wife of 30 years, Angelita Galarza.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair have five children together. Other than this, nothing else is known about Guzmán’s dating life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Catherine Zeta-Jones</h2><p>Welsh actress <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> is well known for her versatility in movies and series. Her well-known works include The Mask of Zorro, Entrapment, The Haunting, Traffic, America’s Sweethearts, and Chicago.</p><p>On Wednesday, the 53-year-old plays the role of Morticia Addams. To date, she has won several honors, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony Award.&nbsp;</p><p>She received the CBE designation for her contributions to humanitarian causes and the film industry in 2010.&nbsp; Zeta-Jones has one of the longest marriages in the Hollywood Industry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She had an exciting dating life before she met her current husband, Michael Douglas. Zeta-Jones was introduced to the American actor by Danny DeVito at the Deauville American Film Festival in France in August 1998.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair have an age difference of 25 years, but it did not stop them from starting their relationship. They got engaged on December 31, 1999, and married almost a year later.</p><p>After Douglas’s divorce was officially finalized on November 18, 2000, they were married at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. The <a href=# rel=noopener>BBC</a> dubbed the high-profile event, which cost an estimated £1.5 million, the “wedding of the year.”&nbsp;</p><p>The couple has two children — a son named Dylan Michael and a daughter named Carys Zeta. Until 2009, the family resided in Bermuda, but since 2016, they have been living in New York.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Isaac Ordonez</h3><p>There is not much information on Issac Ordonez since the actor has just entered the entertainment industry. All we know about his bio are his age and career to date.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Ordonez was born on April 15, 2009, in Los Angeles, California, making his age 13 as of 2022.

His recent project was Wednesday, in which he played the role of Fester Addams.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Armisen’s dating life and history are pretty messy. From 1998 to 2004, he was <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> to English singer-songwriter Sally Timms.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in 2009, he married actress Elisabeth Moss only to get <a href=# rel=noopener>divorced</a> two years later in 2011. Moss called their time together “extremely <a href=# rel=noopener>traumatic</a> and awful and horrible.”</p><p>She went on to say that the best way to characterize Armisen was, “He’s so great at doing impersonations. But the greatest impersonation he does is that of a normal person.”</p><p>After Moss, Armisen dated the artist Alice Lancaster. But once again, their relationship did not work.&nbsp;</p><p>It is reported that after their breakup, Lancaster made a painting <a href=# rel=noopener>dedicated</a> to the actor titled ‘Fred Armisen: Portrait of a Sociopath.’ Armisen is aware of his failed relationships.</p><p>He confessed to Howard Stern, “I think I was a terrible husband. I think I’m a terrible boyfriend. I feel bad for everyone I’ve gone out with.”</p><p>Armisen’s longest relationship was with actress Natasha Lyonne. The pair began dating in 2014, and they parted ways in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyonne acknowledged that they had broken up in April 2022. He remarked that the couple still loved one other about as much as two people can love each other, and they were still chatting all the time.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Riki Lindhome</h3><p>Erika Lindhome, best known as Riki Lindhome, is an American actress, comedian, and singer.

Her age is 42 in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Ricci’s filmography and bio are quite interesting.

In addition to nominations for a Golden Globe, two Primetime Emmys, and a Screen Actors Guild Award, she has received a number of honors, including a National Board of Review Award, a Satellite Award, and other recognitions.</p><p>The actress made her cinematic debut at the young age of nine with Mermaids.

Ricci said in her divorce <a href=# rel=noopener>suit</a> that Heerdegen subjected her to serious physical and emotional abuse.</p><p>To make matters worse, she confessed that several of these acts of violence occurred in front of their kid. This was corroborated by previous incidents where police were called to the pair’s house.</p><p>On June 25, 2020, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a report at Ricci and Heerdegen’s Woodland Hills, California residence. Although Heerdegen was not arrested, Ricci received an emergency protective order against Heerdegen the day before she filed for divorce.&nbsp;</p><p>Ricci was awarded a domestic violence restraining order against Heerdegen in January 2021.
