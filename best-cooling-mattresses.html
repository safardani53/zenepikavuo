Doctors recommend keeping the thermostat set between 15.6C and 19.4C.</p><p>If you struggle to keep your temperature down at night, here are some tips to help:</p><li>Open the window or door to your bedroom to improve the air flow to your room.</li><li>Switch from duvets to blankets or even a cotton sheet and get cooling pillows to complete your set.</li><li>Before you go to bed, have a warm shower - your body will cool off as the water dries.</li><li>Avoid having cold showers as this can overstimulate your body and keep you awake for longer.</li><li>Diet can help as well. Before you go to bed, make sure you only have light meals and don't drink large amounts of alcohol.</li><p>To help you stay cool all year round, we've picked out the best cool mattresses and mattress toppers.</p><h2>Best cooling mattress and mattress toppers at a glance:</h2><li><strong>Best premium mattress</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Emma Premium Mattress</a></li><li><strong>Best luxury hybrid mattress</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Simba Hybrid Luxe mattress</a></li><li><strong>Best budget hybrid mattress</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Inofia memory foam and sprung ventilated mattress</a></li><li><strong>Best for restless sleepers</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Vesgantti pocket sprung mattress with breathable foam</a></li><li><strong>Best moisture-wicking</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eve sleep original hybrid spring and memory foam </a>m<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attress</a></li><li><strong>Best gel hybrid mattress</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">iGel Advance 1600i mattress&nbsp;</a></li><li><strong>Best for back support</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Silentnight Miracoil GelTex mattress&nbsp;</a></li><li><strong>Best mattress topper</strong>: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Panda mattress topper</a></li><h2>1.

For example, if you'r looking at buying a double cooling mattress from Emma or Simba which are the most premium, it could cost around £1,500 but both brands do offer discounts so you could snap one up for under £1,000, sometimes considerably less.</p><p>If that's too pricey, Amazon has a lot of brands that provide cooling mattresses for as little as £250.</p><p>Or, if you don't want to go the whole hog, snap up a mattress topper for £150 or a mattress protector for as little as £30.</p><h2>What to look for in a cooling mattress</h2><p>Cooling mattresses should be able to regulate your body temperature so you don't get all hot and sweaty even on the warmest of nights.</p><p>These work by using gel particles or moisture wicking fabrics to absorb the heat from your body - if it doesn't have this technology then it's not a cooling mattress.</p><p>Of course, you also need to look out for anything that you would want in a regular mattress like firmness, size and whether it's spring, foam or hybrid.</p><h2>What is the best cooling mattress?</h2><p>The best cooling mattress will vary from person to person, as you also need to consider things like firmness, and whether you're after hypoallergenic properties.</p><p>However, based on our experience, we find that the Simba mattress offers the best solution when it comes to keeping cool during the summer - check out our review <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>Avoiding mattresses that only have traditional memory foam will help keep you cool during the summer months too - while they are amazing at supporting our pressure points, memory foam are known to trap body heat.</p><h2>Do cooling mattresses work?</h2><p>Cooling mattresses can help you sleep at a more comfortable temperature than regular mattresses, but as there are a few different types of cooling mattresses, the results can and do vary.</p><p>The most widely available are cooling foam mattresses with gel particles embedded in them or as a layer on top.</p><p>The gel absorbs the heat from your body and then releases it into the air around it so, depending on how breathable the mattress is, a mattress with a gel top layer would work better than one with gel particles embedded throughout.</p><p>You can also get mattresses that use moisture-wicking fabrics that are cool to the touch, which can help to pull the heat away from your body.</p><p>These are best on spring mattresses rather than foam ones as the space in the mattress helps the heat to escape.</p><p>For something fully adjustable, you can try an air or waterbed that will allow you to change the temperature and firmness to suit you.</p><p>Apart from air and waterbeds, where the temperature is constantly being monitored and adjusted, most mattresses will be cool when you first get into bed, which can help you get to sleep, but they do warm up by the morning.</p><p>If you’re looking for the best cooling mattress to suit you, it’s best to try one and see. Many manufacturers will let you return a mattress within the first three months if it's not a good fit.</p><h2>Do gel mattresses keep you cool?</h2><p>Gaining popularity in the 2010s, gel memory foam is considered a new product in the bedding industry.</p><p>According to the Sleep Foundation, most gel memory foams use "thermal gel", which is cool to touch, or "phase-changing gel", which transitions from a solid to a liquid when the temperature of the mattress rises.</p><p>Testing has suggested that the cooling quality of gel mattresses depends on the brand.</p><p>The Sleep Foundation says that the best options were ones that feature inner springs or are hybrid models.</p><h2>How to cool down a memory foam mattress</h2><p>Traditionally, memory foam mattresses trap body heat making them rather unsuitable for the summer months or hot sleepers.</p><p>However, this can be remedied by buying a specialised mattress topper or cooling pad.</p><p>Cooling sheets are another way to cool down your mattress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppaG6CcYGQaJmeq6RisLC7y6KloGWdlsG1vsSsqp6rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-cooling-mattresses.html&text=12%20best%20cooling%20mattresses%20UK%20for%202023%20including%20Emma%2c%20Simba%20and%20Silentnight&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-cooling-mattresses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-cooling-mattresses.html&title=12%20best%20cooling%20mattresses%20UK%20for%202023%20including%20Emma%2c%20Simba%20and%20Silentnight" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-cooling-mattresses.html&title=12%20best%20cooling%20mattresses%20UK%20for%202023%20including%20Emma%2c%20Simba%20and%20Silentnight" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-cooling-mattresses.html&title=12%20best%20cooling%20mattresses%20UK%20for%202023%20including%20Emma%2c%20Simba%20and%20Silentnight" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-cooling-mattresses.html&description=12%20best%20cooling%20mattresses%20UK%20for%202023%20including%20Emma%2c%20Simba%20and%20Silentnight" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jimmy-kimmel-aaron-rodgers-feud-timeline-5217958.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Timeline of Their Feud  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mike-vrabel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wife, Stats, Draft, Son &amp;amp; Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
