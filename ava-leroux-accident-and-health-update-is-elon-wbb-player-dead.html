The basketball player is said to be fighting for her life in the ICU.</strong></p><p>Leroux plays as a center for Elon University and committed to the side in 2021. She is the eldest child of former NHL player Francois Leroux.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ava-leroux-elon-university.jpg><p>After retiring from the NHL, Francois worked in construction for many years. He has been working as a maintenance crew at Allegheny Health Network’s Wexford Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Ava’s mother, Lori Leroux, is an educator, and the young basketball talent also has twin siblings. The Leroux family has not provided any statement about Ava’s health condition, but we pray for the talented youngster’s recovery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ava Leroux Accident And Health Update</h2><p>The former South Fayette High School standout Ava Leroux was involved in a serious accident on Friday. The Elon Women’s Basketball team has shared a recent health update about Ava.</p><p>The Elon Women’s Basketball Facebook <a href=# rel=noopener>page</a> shared that Ava remained in ICU, and everyone in the university has been praying for her progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Brad Everett, the sports reporter for Pittsburgh Union Progress, was the first person to break the news of Ava’s accident. Brad shared an article he wrote about Ava and her father and urged his followers to pray for Ava’s speedy recovery.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ava’s Basketball Career&nbsp;</h3><p>Leroux stands at 6’4, only two inches shorter than her former hockey-playing father, Francois. Ava committed to Elon last year in November.&nbsp;</p><p>She plays as a forward/center and under head coach Bryan Bennett at South Fayette, helped her side to the 2022 WPIAL 5A championship. At South Fayette, Ava also earned the first-team al-section honors.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ava-leroux-basketball-career.jpg><p>Leroux has also played in AAU basketball for SLAAM, and by the end of 2021, she had already received ten Division I offers. During high school, Ava starred as a middle hitter on the South Fayette volleyball team.&nbsp;</p><p>Her previous coach, Bennett, described her as a versatile player. Bennett said, “We can get her the ball inside. She catches the ball at the 3-point line and can handle it and blow by you.”</p><h2>Ava Leroux Parents: Meet Francois And Lori Leroux</h2><p>Ava Leroux’s parents, Francois and Lori Leroux supported their daughter’s basketball career from a young age. The Elon basketball player thought of playing hockey when she was younger, but basketball drew her attention.&nbsp;</p><p>The love for hockey was meant to be. Her father, Francois Leroux, was born in Ste-Adele, Canada. He played in defense and began his hockey career in the QMAAA league.&nbsp;</p><p>He previously played one season at the Edmonton Oilers in 1988, but that was only for two games. From 1988-1992, Francois played for the Oilers several times.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ava-leroux-parents.jpg><p>In 1993, he joined the Ottawa Senators and played 23 games. In 1994, Francois signed for the Pittsburgh Penguins and played three seasons with the NHL side.</p><p>An infamous video of Francois is widespread among hockey fans might be aware of. It is his fight with the former St. Louis Blues forward Tony Twist. A fan favorite, Francois was known as “Frankie” by many.</p><p>In an interview with Post Gazette in 2021, Ava said her father was still learning basketball. Her mother, Lori, is native to Monongahela and is a Ringgold graduate.&nbsp;</p><p>Ava’s parents were said to be present at her games. Ava also has twin siblings, Juliette and Quinn. At the time, Juliette was studying in eighth grade and had followed in her sister’s footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p>Juliette said it was her dream to play alongside her sister Ava. Meanwhile, Ava’s brother had followed in his father’s footsteps and had shown interest in hockey.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCt1ZpkpZ2ipMK5ecCcmqKclaPBbq3NnWShnZGhwal51KmbmqyVYra0ecSlpqdlp5evbrzLmrCeql2ZsqKwjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fava-leroux-accident-and-health-update-is-elon-wbb-player-dead.html&text=Ava%20Leroux%20Accident%20And%20Health%20Update%3a%20Is%20Elon%20WBB%20Player%20Dead%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fava-leroux-accident-and-health-update-is-elon-wbb-player-dead.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fava-leroux-accident-and-health-update-is-elon-wbb-player-dead.html&title=Ava%20Leroux%20Accident%20And%20Health%20Update%3a%20Is%20Elon%20WBB%20Player%20Dead%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fava-leroux-accident-and-health-update-is-elon-wbb-player-dead.html&title=Ava%20Leroux%20Accident%20And%20Health%20Update%3a%20Is%20Elon%20WBB%20Player%20Dead%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fava-leroux-accident-and-health-update-is-elon-wbb-player-dead.html&title=Ava%20Leroux%20Accident%20And%20Health%20Update%3a%20Is%20Elon%20WBB%20Player%20Dead%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fava-leroux-accident-and-health-update-is-elon-wbb-player-dead.html&description=Ava%20Leroux%20Accident%20And%20Health%20Update%3a%20Is%20Elon%20WBB%20Player%20Dead%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chris-pine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Pine  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./julia-louis-dreyfus-why-she-wont-get-a-facelift.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why She Won't Get a Facelift">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
