I need to be with a man I interact with.&nbsp;</p><p>“The days should not follow and be alike. I would be afraid to be bored“</p><p>They married in 2009, had two children but by 2018 they had divorced.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, Igor - in his sixties - had a brief relationship with 23-year-old biology student Julie Jardon.&nbsp;</p><p>In November that year <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was arrested</a> for breaking into Jardon’s house after they had split.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, the twins turned their hand to cryptocurrency after claiming to have invented Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Grichka said on <a href=#>French TV</a>: “Igor and I, as mathematicians, were able to participate in the elaboration of some of the [Bitcoin] source code, especially the ‘predictive code’.”</p><h2>Masked singer and '£670,000 scam'</h2><p>Last year they took part on the French version of the Masked Singer, performing Bamboleo by the Gipsy Kings and Yesterday by The Beatles.&nbsp;</p><p>The twins donned parakeet outfits while competing in the singing contest.&nbsp;</p><p>But they faced serious legal charges in their final years - after being accused last year of defrauding a troubled millionaire.&nbsp;</p><p>The case accused the twins of “swindling” a 53-year-old hotelier known only as Cyrille P who killed himself in 2018.</p><p>The millionaire had reportedly invested €800,000 (£670,000) on a revival of Temps X.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tragic 'Covid deaths' after refusing jab</h2><p>In December, the twins were admitted to intensive care on the same day.&nbsp;</p><p>Their friend former French minister of education Luc Ferry told how the brothers didn’t believe they needed the vaccine.</p><p>He told <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Parisien</a></strong>: “I told [Grichka] it was grotesque. How crazy they were.<br>“Being very athletic, without a gram of fat, they believed that the vaccine was more dangerous as the virus.</p><p>"What stupidity, but what stupidity! Grichka was an out of the world, singular character, anything but a villain.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Grichka died of Covid complications on December 28 as Igor lay in a coma unaware his brother had died.&nbsp;</p><p>Six days later, Igor also died - his cause of death is yet to be confirmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2e769b74-2c89-4445-8269-cd5d52d654a7.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000703329458-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1817aa9b-09ab-4b80-b7d2-151d8009cc51.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Igor Bogdanov and Julie Jardon at 'Twin Peaks' Official Screening Red Carpet</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY25%2FeIWPaKCgp6JitLO1wqGimmWSpLSlrc2onZ9lpKy2r7%2BMnKavoZRiwLa%2Bxp6psmWWlrqwwdJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2figor-grichka-bogdanoff-twins-covid-surgery-famous.html&text=Inside%20bizarre%20life%20of%20Bogdanoff%20brothers%20-%20from%20arrest%20after%20age-gap%20relationship%20to%20%27670%2c000%20sca&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2figor-grichka-bogdanoff-twins-covid-surgery-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2figor-grichka-bogdanoff-twins-covid-surgery-famous.html&title=Inside%20bizarre%20life%20of%20Bogdanoff%20brothers%20-%20from%20arrest%20after%20age-gap%20relationship%20to%20%27670%2c000%20sca" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2figor-grichka-bogdanoff-twins-covid-surgery-famous.html&title=Inside%20bizarre%20life%20of%20Bogdanoff%20brothers%20-%20from%20arrest%20after%20age-gap%20relationship%20to%20%27670%2c000%20sca" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2figor-grichka-bogdanoff-twins-covid-surgery-famous.html&title=Inside%20bizarre%20life%20of%20Bogdanoff%20brothers%20-%20from%20arrest%20after%20age-gap%20relationship%20to%20%27670%2c000%20sca" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2figor-grichka-bogdanoff-twins-covid-surgery-famous.html&description=Inside%20bizarre%20life%20of%20Bogdanoff%20brothers%20-%20from%20arrest%20after%20age-gap%20relationship%20to%20%27670%2c000%20sca" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kim-zolciak-bares-butt-to-show-off-latest-cosmetic-procedure.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Zolciak Bares Butt to Show Off Latest Cosmetic Procedure">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jay-z-mom-4725486.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everything To Know About Gloria Carter  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
