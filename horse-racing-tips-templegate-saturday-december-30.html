Trainer Paul Nicholls is trying to win this race for the fourth year running.</p><p><strong>MARTATOR (1.15 Newbury, nb)</strong></p><p>He has been knocking on the door and ran a cracker when a close-up second here just 10 days ago.

He seemed to enjoy the drop back to this distance and Venetia Williams’ excellent run of form keeps rolling on.</p><p>This six-year-old is well handicapped and looks hard to beat in a race the yard won twice in the past three seasons.</p><p>Guy has dropped to just 1lb higher than his last win and he’s run well a couple of times at Cheltenham this season. He usually travels well before finding less than you’d hope and he is likely to fade into the places here.</p><p>Richhill was a fair third here latest and has had a little nudge down the weights. It’s early days over fences so there should be more to come.</p><p>1.50</p><p>GET A TONIC was impressive when winning by seven lengths over course and distance earlier this month. The handicapper has put him up 8lb but he jumped beautifully and can take another step forward.</p><p>Steal A March is interesting coming back from a year off. He was a good second on his last run here before winning at Wincanton on Boxing Day. He may need this outing but is worth keeping an eye on.</p><p>Rambo T is only 4lb higher than his last win and didn’t get home here last time. It would be no shock to see him bounce back eased in trip.</p><p>2.25</p><p>ATLANTA BRAVE looks capable of improvement after an encouraging second at Exeter last time. He enjoyed being stepped up to 3m on just his second spin over fences and this longer trip will help. He looks on a fair weight and Kerry Lee’s horses have been running well.</p><p>Certainly Red loves a stamina test and will be doing his best work at the finish. More rain would help his chances as he likes it testing.</p><p>Bowtogreatness goes well fresh so his layoff isn’t a worry. He was last seen going close in good company at Aintree and looks a danger.</p><p>3.00</p><p>CAPTAIN TEAGUE was a brilliant third in the Champion Bumper last season and kicked off his hurdles career with a Grade 2 win at Chepstow. He then went close in good company at Cheltenham last time and wouldn’t have to improve much to be a major player here.</p><p>Willmount jumped well when hammering some fairly modest rivals here last time and should take a big step forward for Nicky Henderson.</p><p>Lookaway ran a belter when second in the red-hot Greatwood at Cheltenham last time on the back of three good wins. He has every chance of hitting the frame.</p><p>3.35</p><p>PASSING WELL looked a nice prospect when winning on his second chase start at Lingfield last month. That built on a good debut second at Ascot and the form of both races is working out well. He has a lot more to offer over fences and could be well ahead of the handicapper.</p><p>Ballycamus would ideally like the ground softer as it was when he won gamely at Chepstow latest. He is another who should have more to come.</p><p>Golden Son has decent hurdles form and should be capable of better than the modest form we’ve seen over fences so far.</p><p><strong>TAUNTON</strong></p><p>2.10</p><p>QUEENS GAMBLE was good enough to run midfield in the Champion Bumper and has transferred that class to hurdling. She kicked off with an easy win at Warwick before leaving that behind when jumping beautifully to score at Kempton last time.</p><p>Casa No Mento looks the main danger after winning her two hurdles runs by a combined 21 lengths. This is a marked hike in class but she looks ready for it and can make her presence felt.</p><p>Larchmont Lass was a Listed bumper winner last season and looked very green when second on her first spin over hurdles here earlier this month. It’s interesting to see Paul Nicholls hike her sharply in grade and she should improve significantly.</p><p>2.45</p><p>KING OF THE LAKE looks to be crying out for this trip after a run of good efforts over slightly shorter. He has hit the frame on every start including when third at Exeter latest. He has had a little nudge down the weights which can see him over the line.</p><p>Game Winner comes back to the smaller obstacles after a couple of modest runs over fences. He was a good winner at Kempton last season and the first-time cheekpieces could help.</p><p>Hurricane Harvey has dropped to just 1lb higher than his good second in a big field at Cheltenham in April. He was far from disgraced at Newbury last time and is another to consider.</p><p><strong>HAYDOCK</strong></p><p>1.25</p><p>COLLECTORS ITEM has been finding three miles on the sharp side so this longer trip in bottomless ground should be right up his street. He finished strongly at Sandown last time and has every chance from a falling handicap mark.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Fantastikas can make jumping errors but he keeps plodding on and is another who will relish the testing conditions. He was a close second at Ludlow last time and the Twiston-Davies horses have been in good nick.</p><p>East Street has gone close on his past two runs with a battling win at Wetherby before a neck second at Newcastle 16 days ago. He needs a lot of rousting along but keeps going and will be running on at the finish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Templegate's tips</h2><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
