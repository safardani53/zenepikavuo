However, he changed his mind after getting through the MBL draft held that year.</p><h2>How tall is Dustin May?- Age and Height</h2><p>Already seen as the prodigy and genius when it comes to pitching, Dustin May seems big, but he is still a young man. Yes, Dustin May, aka the <strong>“Gingergaard,”</strong> is just in his early 20s.</p><p>To be more specific, May was born in the year 1997, which makes him 26 years old. Also, he celebrates his birthday every year on the sixth of September.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gillian Turner Age, Height, Parents, Ballet, Fox News, Fiance, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Not to mention, his sun sign happens to be Virgo, who is known to be a perfectionist, intelligent, and smart.</p><p>We are sure to win the game strategy is essential, but it is the brawl that keeps them going in the field.</p><p>Likewise, May might be young, but he is already 6 feet 6 inches(198 cm) tall and weighs about 82 kgs(180 lbs). Aside from that, the exact measurements of his athletic physique are unknown.</p><p>However, we know he has long red hair and dark brown eyes contrasting his fair skin complexion.</p><h2>Professional Debut- MLB, Stats, and AZL Dodgers</h2><p>As we have talked about earlier, Dustin is a born-pitcher who has been in the field ever since his high school days.</p><p>He played junior baseball at the Northwest High School and was committing to play at the college level.</p><p>In just a few months, May was getting ready to play for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. However, his decision changed once he got drafted in the 2016 Major League Baseball Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>To be more specific, May was picked by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round and 101. Just a teenager, he signed a million contracts to join the Dodgers.</p><p>As expected, the Dodgers were quick to put May in the field and get that strike.</p><p>That same year, he made his MLB debut with the AZL Dodgers and spent the whole season there. His first game ended with a 3.86 ERA in 30.1 innings pitched.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dustin-001.jpg><p>Likewise, in 2017.

He also ranked fifth in Rookie of the Year&nbsp;voting.</p><h3>Dustin May to Appear at the Dodger’s Finale against Astros</h3><p>On June 29, it was announced that Dustin May, the genius pitcher, will be appearing for the Dodgers finale against their rival, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Astros</a>.</p><p>After three years, Dustin will be meeting his rival pitcher, both 1997 born<strong>&nbsp;Cristian Javier</strong>.</p><p>Before this, the two met for the first time in 2017&nbsp;at the Midwest League, where their team met at Modern Woodmen Park located in Davenport, Iowa.</p><p>This is not the only important thing to happen to Dustin.

I expect him to go out there and compete as he has basically from day one in the big leagues.”</h3><h2>Dustin May | Injury and Surgery</h2><p>The top young starting pitcher for Los Angeles Dodgers had to undergo Tommy John Surgery performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache in May 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The surgery is likely to pause his playing career for at least a year.&nbsp; He faced the injury while starting for the team against the Milwaukee Brewers on May 1 in the second inning.&nbsp;</p><p>He threw a pitch and tore his UCL, called the trainer, and exited the game.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income- How much does Dustin earn in a year?</h2><p>Drafted in 2016 and started in the major league in 2019, Dustin has more to cover when it comes to wealth.</p><p>Fame has surely has earned from his debut days, but we are sure as time passes, wealth will come to him too.</p><p>Hence, the young Dustin’s net worth is unknown at the moment.
