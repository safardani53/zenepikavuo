It’s horrifying.”</p><p>They added: “For a long time people have been worried about the dogs in the care of the Ayrshire Ark.</p><p>“Now it seems like their worst fears have been confirmed.

Dogs who are known to be uncomfortable around children are being given to people with kids.”</p><p>The source also accused sanctuary bosses of losing pets in their care. They said: “We believe many dogs which have been in the hands of the rescue are now missing. Nobody can tell us where they are.</p><p>“We have also heard stories about people putting their dogs into the Ayrshire Ark for boarding and getting them back malnourished and poorly.</p><p>“People have always feared the conditions inside were bad, but I don’t think anyone will be prepared for just how awful it really is.”</p><p>Insiders claim that punters interested in re-homing dogs have regularly been denied access to the schoolhouse — sparking fears the rescue had something to conceal.</p><p>Instead, visitors are allegedly told to wait in the car park while mutts are brought outside to meet them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/nintchdbpict000286583302.jpg><p>Another source said: “The fact that nobody gets to see inside the building had already set alarm bells ringing.</p><p>“We have never heard of anyone getting to go in and look at all the dogs, like you would at other rescues. People are expected to choose one they like from pictures online, then it’s brought outside for them to see when they visit.</p><p>“If they decide to go ahead and adopt, it’s the same story — the dog gets led out to the car park for them to take away.</p><p>“Either that or a driver delivers it to its new home.”</p><p>Families who adopted dogs in the past say they were never vetted to ensure they could offer a loving and suitable home.</p><p>They also claim the sanctuary didn’t request references.</p><p>Bosses at Ayrshire Ark describe themselves as a non-profit organisation.</p><p>They use social media to appeal for public donations which they claim will help save dogs’ lives.</p><p>Some loyal supporters have signed up to make monthly contributions, with others offering gifts like food for the hounds instead. The Ayrshire Ark’s Facebook page had vanished yesterday.</p><p>A Scottish SPCA inspector said: “We recently attended an address in East Ayrshire and our investigations are ongoing at this time.”</p><p>Cops added: “We were called to assist the SSPCA following a report of a dog having died at a property in Patna, Ayrshire. Inquiries are ongoing.”</p><p><b>We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
