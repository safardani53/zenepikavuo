He picked up like a sprinter at the end of 2m4f to win going away. That turn of pace will be a major asset on this drop in distance and he looks capable of improving again for Frankie and the Gosdens.</p><p><strong>HAATEM (3.25 Goodwood, nb)</strong></p><p>He was best of the rest behind potential superstar City Of Troy in the Superlative Stakes at Newmarket 17 days ago. That was an excellent run upped to this trip for the first time after his good fifth in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot. He goes on any ground and can improve again.</p><p><strong>MILLEBOSC (2.50 Goodwood, treble)</strong></p><p>He got no luck in the John Smith’s Cup at York. He had a horrible wide draw which was made worse by a slow start and he had to come from a mile back up the straight. He did well to run into seventh and will be fitter for that first race of the season.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £5 Get £20 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Bet UK: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets and Bonuses</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>William Hill: Bet £10 Get £40 in Free Bets (MOBILE ONLY)* </strong>- <strong></strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener"><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only.

He’s in the mix again.</p><p>Navello got up late to win the Epsom Dash last time and horses that go well there often thrive at Goodwood.</p><p>A 3lb rise in the weights gives him a chance with William Buick in the saddle.</p><p>Alligator Alley is coming down the weights and tanked along when third at Doncaster last time.</p><p>He’s had a little break since then and would be a major threat if able to back that run up.</p><p>Lihou went close on his last run here and is back off the same mark. He likes a tricky track and has solid each-way claims.</p><p>Lord Riddiford has won the past two renewals of this race and this is his cup final. His recent form has been modest so he’s 3lb lower than last year.</p><p>2.15</p><p>ARRAY looked a really nice prospect with a close-up second at Newbury on debut.</p><p>Trainer Andrew Balding had left a bit to work on so there should be more to come fitness-wise too. He can build on that excellent start.</p><p>Fusterlandia has run well three times with a tough assignment at Royal Ascot his only blip.</p><p>He went close when second at Nottingham over 5f latest and this move up in distance could do the trick.</p><p>Alaskan Gold was a relatively expensive buy and trainer Karl Burke has been firing in plenty of good juvenile winners this season.</p><p>He wasn’t beaten far on debut at Nottingham 11 days ago and will take a big step forward.</p><p>Union Island was hauled in right on the line on his first racecourse start at Hamilton.</p><p>He can leave that form behind. Bu Sidra was very green when beaten in a photo at Brighton.</p><p>This is tougher but he’ll improve for that run. Havanagreattime wasn’t asked too many questions when third on debut at Windsor and is another with more to come.</p><p>A La Noche looks the pick of the newcomers from Richard Hannon.</p><p>2.50</p><p>THE John Smith’s Cup at York could be the key form here and MILLEBOSC got no luck on the Knavesmire.</p><p>He had a horrible wide draw which was made worse by a slow start and he had to come from a mile back up the straight.</p><p>He did well to run into seventh and will be fitter for that first race of the season.</p><p>Haunted Dream was slightly unlucky to finish only third that day after he was bumped in the closing stages.</p><p>Pride Of America won the race after a real battle and can’t be ruled out either despite a 4lb rise in the weights and a modest draw today.</p><p>Eagle’s Way landed four lesser wins before running another cracker when second at last week’s Racing League.</p><p>That was a good race and Sir Mark Prescott’s hopeful has more to come.</p><p>Lord Protector beat Haunted Dream when they met at Sandown and he seems to have improved since finishing fifth in this last season.</p><p>Caius Chorister had a rare blip at Pontefract after going well twice at Epsom.</p><p>He’s off the same mark as the second of those efforts and he won at last year’s Glorious meeting.</p><p>He’s a stone higher now so will need to improve but that track form is a major plus.</p><p>3.25</p><p>HAATEM was best of the rest behind potential superstar City Of Troy in the Superlative Stakes at Newmarket 17 days ago.</p><p>That was an excellent run upped to this trip for the first time after his good fifth in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p><p>He goes on any ground and can improve again.</p><p>Soldier’s Gold deserves this step out of handicap company after an impressive success at Ascot.</p><p>That was over 6f but he shapes like he’ll stay and Hugo Palmer’s horses have been running well.</p><p>Thunder Blue landed a maiden here in great style before a decent fifth in the Norfolk.</p><p>He ran to a similar level when fourth in the July Stakes at Newmarket and is a contender if getting the longer distance.</p><p>Mountain Bear won a Curragh maiden for Aidan O’Brien before a slightly disappointing July Stakes effort.</p><p>It’s still early days for this well-bred type and it would be no surprise to see him go much better here.</p><p>Iberian didn’t have a lot to beat at Newbury on debut but did it nicely and looks the type to show more over this distance.</p><p>Golden Mind was a close-up third in the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot so is a proven stayer who is no forlorn hope under Frankie.</p><p>4.00</p><p>KINROSS is a high-class performer who has a win and second in this race on his CV.</p><p>After looking rusty at Royal Ascot he ran close to his best when a close-up third in the July Cup at Newmarket last time.</p><p>Trainer Ralph Beckett’s horses are in excellent form and Frankie is back to do the steering.</p><p>Audience was impressive when seeing off Jumby in the Criterion Stakes last time.</p><p>He sees out this trip strongly and could improve with relatively few miles on the clock.</p><p>Jumby is back with an each-way chance along with Pogo who was third in that race on the July course.</p><p>Isaac Shelby has been holding his own in Group 1 company since winning the Greenham at Newbury on comeback in April.</p><p>He drops back to his best trip here which could give him the boost he needs.</p><p>He gets valuable weight as a three-year-old who is on the upgrade.</p><p>Al Suhail did well in Dubai this spring before probably finding six furlongs on the sharp side when sixth in the QEII Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p><p>He goes on any ground and has an each-way shout.</p><p>Indestructible didn’t fire in a French Group 1 latest and needs to raise his game.</p><p>4.35</p><p>COURAGE MON AMI pulled off a brilliant feat to win the Ascot Gold Cup on just his fourth racecourse run last time.</p><p>He picked up like a sprinter at the end of 2m4f to win going away.</p><p>That turn of pace will be a major asset on this drop in distance and he looks capable of improving again for Frankie and the Gosdens.</p><p>Coltrane was second to the tip latest and seems to have improved since finishing fourth in this race 12 months ago.</p><p>He handles any ground and looks a major contender.</p><p>Giavelotto is going the right way and dug deep to win the Yorkshire Cup last time out in May.</p><p>He should no problems with this longer distance and is unexposed as a stayer.</p><p>Emily Dickinson had plenty left in the tank when taking the Curragh Cup just ten days ago.</p><p>It’s asking a bit to come out and run again so soon but she was a decent fourth in the Ascot Gold Cup so has plenty of ability.</p><p>Eldar Eldarov was unlucky in the Yorkshire Cup before a disappointing run at the Royal meeting. He has a few questions to answer now.</p><p>Quickthorn and Ocean Wind are both solid stayers who could hit the frame if showing their very best.</p><p>5.05</p><p>ESPRESSOO has been in flying form this season with an Ayr win followed by two good Listed efforts, especially when second at Pontefract three weeks ago.</p><p>He likes a bit of give in the ground and drops back into a handicap from an attractive mark.</p><p>Rowayeh has a poor draw but looks a nice prospect after battling to victory at Sandown latest.</p><p>The form of that race is working out well and he can cope with a 5lb rise in the weights. Keep an eye on him whatever happens here.</p><p>Novus was unlucky to finish second at Sandown last time when squeezed in the final furlong.</p><p>She’s back from the same mark and can figure at what looks a big price.</p><p>She’s Hot has had a wind op since a solid second at Newbury 55 days ago. Dropping back in distance is another tick in her box.</p><p>Bridestones was tried at Group 1 level earlier this season by the Gosdens and was less than a length away in a Listed contest last time.</p><p>Her handicap mark of 93 looks fair and she’ll be in the mix.</p><p>Floating Spirit didn’t stay 1m2f at Newmarket when last seen in May and is more effective over this trip.</p><p>5.35</p><p>EXECUTIVE DECISION has only been with the Osbornes for two runs since moving from Ireland.</p><p>She was much improved when fifth in a hot handicap at Newmarket last time and has had a little nudge down the weights.</p><p>Kitai has won his past two outings nicely and enjoyed a bit of dig in the ground at Pontefract latest.</p><p>He’s up 7lb for that but is progressing and should figure again.</p><p>Funny Story has been in good form on quick ground with a Nottingham win and Ayr Listed fifth. She’d figure is handling these slower conditions.</p><p>Granary Queen went close on her last run over this course and distance in June.</p><p>Crack apprentice Harry Davies takes off 3lb which should make her competitive.</p><p>Crazy Luck met trouble in running when midfield in this race 12 months ago and can’t be dismissed from a 4lb lower mark this time.</p><p>Sophia’s Starlight was below par at Newmarket latest but had earlier won three in four outings, including over this trip.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>She’s crept up the weights but can’t be totally dismissed.</p><p>Mottisfont finished strongly over this trip at HQ last time and the strong pace we’re likely to get here will draw out his stamina.</p><h2>Templegate's tips</h2><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
