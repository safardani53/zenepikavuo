If you talk about real estate, they were in prime position.</p><p>"A couple of holes appeared where they hadn't maintained the groins, and every year the council would turn up and take stones and dump them in front of <a href=#>the beach huts</a>.</p><p>"One December there was a mad panic and they said they needed to move <a href=#>the beach huts</a> before a storm.</p><p>"They moved us here, they said it was temporary, they never said where the permanent location would be, it's been four years now and no sign of that changing."</p><p>Alan is "disappointed" and while <a href=#>grateful the move was free</a>, he is now in a cul-de-sac of huts, some without sea-facing views, unlike his.</p><p>The sea's onward march has also destroyed a car park and is already eating away at the driving range on Sinah Common <a href=#>golf club</a>.</p><p>Mr Doak, who has lived on Hayling since 1994, is livid at the situation.</p><h2>NEED A FERRY FOR THE FERRY</h2><p>He told The Sun&nbsp;the old wooden <a href=#>sea wall</a> only&nbsp;needed around 40 planks replaced - but the council said the roughly £6 million rebuild was too expensive.</p><p>Mr Doak fumed: "So they spent millions taking it all out and losing the beach.</p><p>"Now they do a <a href=#>s*** job on it every bloody year and keep botching it</a>. If it carries on we will need a ferry to get to the ferry."</p><p>Havant Council say they spend a whopping £430,000 on beach works every year.</p><p>And the <a href=#>Environment Agency</a> has awarded the council £3.3 million over seven-years to combat erosion.</p><p>But not everyone is so anti the&nbsp;efforts, with many locals arguing it is vital to stop Hayling slipping into the sea.</p><p>Ken Hearn, 89, was walking along the seafront where thousands of tonnes of aggregate has been placed to build up the beach.</p><p>He pointed out how the old promenade was buried around 5ft under the aggregate, but stressed: "There are <a href=#>27 foot high swells</a>. We need the build up to stop houses getting flooded.</p><p>"In a big swell, it builds and builds, often without warning. It starts coming over the top, it washes it (the defences away) and it piles it up."</p><p>The retired Air Sea rescue veteran reckons the sea has risen about six inches in twenty years due to climate change.</p><p>Mrs Rogers and Elaine Grey were walking their rabble of terriers when they spoke to The Sun&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs Rogers, who has visited Hayling since the 1960s, recalled <a href=#>stunning sand dunes</a>, but now walks along big pebbles.</p><p>But she stressed: "It's eroding, the sea is taking over, obviously they need to put in sea defences to stop&nbsp;this.</p><p>"It's sad, we've lost all the sand dunes, but we've got a lot more people living here now, people need homes and need protecting. So what is the choice?"</p><h2>TOO EXPENSIVE</h2><p>Havant Council say permanent off-shore sea defences would not attract central government funding, as not enough homes are at risk.</p><p>They added: "Alternative coastal management approaches will be explored though our coastal strategy study which will consider their relative cost, benefits and impacts.</p><p>"Offshore structures would need to be very large to provide protection during extreme tides.</p><p>"At low tide they would stand tall, with a significant visual impact and pose a potential hazard to vessels and swimmers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We pick up this shingle and return it by truck back to Eastoke as part of our infrastructure works.</p><p>"This beach recycling operation works with nature to sustain a healthy beach."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-hayling-island-hampshire-beach-851841713.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-hayling-island-hampshire-beach-851841848.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-hayling-island-hampshire-beach-851841984.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-hayling-island-hampshire-beach-851841852.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F1f5NqaW5no5qutLXDnmStp6ejeqmt2KWgp59dmbK0wNGosJ6cXZfGbq%2FOrqWcoZxivbO7yZ6aratf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fseaside-town-hayling-destroyed-by-council-projects.html&text=We%20live%20on%20a%20UK%20island%20-%20it%20was%20paradise%20but%20now%20it%27s%20being%20ruined%20by%20council%20our%20pub%20will%20end%20up&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fseaside-town-hayling-destroyed-by-council-projects.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fseaside-town-hayling-destroyed-by-council-projects.html&title=We%20live%20on%20a%20UK%20island%20-%20it%20was%20paradise%20but%20now%20it%27s%20being%20ruined%20by%20council%20our%20pub%20will%20end%20up" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fseaside-town-hayling-destroyed-by-council-projects.html&title=We%20live%20on%20a%20UK%20island%20-%20it%20was%20paradise%20but%20now%20it%27s%20being%20ruined%20by%20council%20our%20pub%20will%20end%20up" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fseaside-town-hayling-destroyed-by-council-projects.html&title=We%20live%20on%20a%20UK%20island%20-%20it%20was%20paradise%20but%20now%20it%27s%20being%20ruined%20by%20council%20our%20pub%20will%20end%20up" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fseaside-town-hayling-destroyed-by-council-projects.html&description=We%20live%20on%20a%20UK%20island%20-%20it%20was%20paradise%20but%20now%20it%27s%20being%20ruined%20by%20council%20our%20pub%20will%20end%20up" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ewa-sonnet-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ewa Sonnet Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hot-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hot Pics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
