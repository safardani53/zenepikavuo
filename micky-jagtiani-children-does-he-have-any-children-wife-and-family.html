Micky Jagtiani was a well-known entrepreneur and businessman who made important contributions to the retail sector, notably in the Middle East.&nbsp;His death at the age of 70 has left a gap in the corporate world and inspired curiosity in his personal life.</p><p>Micky Jagtiani, whose roots are in India, started on a transforming path that led him to become one of the Middle East’s most successful businessmen. He worked hard to manage his home life with his commercial endeavors as a father of three children. This article goes into Micky Jagtiani’s family history, giving light on their beginnings and focusing on his immediate family, which includes his three children and his parents.</p><h2>Micky Jagtiani Family Origins</h2><p><strong>Micky Jagtiani’s</strong> business attitude was inspired by his family’s Indian roots and relocation to Kuwait. Mukesh Wadhumal Jagtiani was born on August 15, 1952, in Kuwait City, Kuwait.&nbsp;While his great career and accomplishments are well-known, little is known about his family history and beginnings. The Jagtiani family, on the other hand, is said to have origins in India, a common ancestry shared by many Indians living in the Gulf area.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Micky-Jagtiani-1.jpg alt="Micky Jagtiani" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Micky Jagtiani’s</strong> family, like many others from the Indian diaspora, may have gone to Kuwait in quest of better possibilities. The specifics of their travel and the events that led to their residence in Kuwait are not publicly known. Nonetheless, the Jagtiani family’s entrepreneurial spirit and passion for success would determine Micky’s path to becoming a successful businessman.</p><h2>Meet Micky Jagtiani’s Children</h2><p><strong>Micky Jagtiani</strong> is the father of three children, Aarti, Nisha, and Rahul. They are actively engaged in the Landmark Group’s business, holding directorial positions within the company. Although exact facts regarding his children and their names have been kept confidential, Micky Jagtiani was known to have a tight relationship with his family.</p><p>As a successful businessman, he matched his career pursuits with his parental obligations, supporting and encouraging his children as they followed their own life paths. Micky Jagtiani’s children are likely to have had a one-of-a-kind childhood growing up with a father of such significant accomplishments and fortune. Their Father’s entrepreneurial adventure and his commercial empire, the Landmark Group, may have had a big effect on their dreams and objectives.</p><h2>Who Are Micky Jagtiani’s Parents?</h2><p><strong>Micky Jagtiani’s</strong> parents’ identities and backgrounds are not well established.&nbsp;They did, however, play an important part in molding his beliefs, work ethic, and business spirit. Unfortunately, information on their lives and their effect on Micky’s trip is scarce.&nbsp;Although there is little information about Micky Jagtiani’s parents, it is safe to infer that their support, advice, and ideals shaped his character and passion for achievement.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Micky-Jagtiani.jpg alt="Micky Jagtiani" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Their support and conviction in Micky’s ability most certainly created the groundwork for his outstanding accomplishments throughout his career. Their encouragement and the ideals they established in him most certainly influenced his tenacity, drive, and unshakable devotion to achievement.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikopubrnqrrcatoJqmmWKwqbXLnamepl2ZvKa%2FjKGcZqCRq7Jurc2yZJygmaGxs7HNZq6inpVirq%2BwjJ%2BYpqGcrnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmicky-jagtiani-children-does-he-have-any-children-wife-and-family.html&text=Micky%20Jagtiani%20Children%3a%20Does%20He%20Have%20Any%20Children%3f%20Wife%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmicky-jagtiani-children-does-he-have-any-children-wife-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmicky-jagtiani-children-does-he-have-any-children-wife-and-family.html&title=Micky%20Jagtiani%20Children%3a%20Does%20He%20Have%20Any%20Children%3f%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmicky-jagtiani-children-does-he-have-any-children-wife-and-family.html&title=Micky%20Jagtiani%20Children%3a%20Does%20He%20Have%20Any%20Children%3f%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmicky-jagtiani-children-does-he-have-any-children-wife-and-family.html&title=Micky%20Jagtiani%20Children%3a%20Does%20He%20Have%20Any%20Children%3f%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmicky-jagtiani-children-does-he-have-any-children-wife-and-family.html&description=Micky%20Jagtiani%20Children%3a%20Does%20He%20Have%20Any%20Children%3f%20Wife%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sheryl-lee-ralph-weight-loss-journey-before-and-after-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sheryl Lee Ralph Weight Loss Journey: Before And After Photo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./indiana-couple-arrested-for-incest-sleeping-with-own-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Indiana Couple Arrested for Incest, Sleeping with Own Kids">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
