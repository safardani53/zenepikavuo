Holmes</b></a> became the talk of the town when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship</a> came to light in late 2022. The longtime friends were both married to their respective spouses at the time when their romance was revealed, and now, Amy’s ex-husband, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Andrew Shue</b></a>, and T.J.’s former wife, <b>Marilee Feibig</b>, are rumored to be dating.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>What Happened Between Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Amy and T.J. were known for their funny on-air banter and long-term friendship as the co-hosts of <i>GMA3</i>, a <i>Good Morning America</i> spinoff. However, their relationship changed by late 2022. At the time, pictures<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> surfaced online</a> of the two of them showing off PDA while spending time together in New York City.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Many viewers believed their relationship was a scandal, as both were still married to their respective spouses. However, Amy was reportedly in the process of divorcing Andrew at the time when the photos of her and T.J. circulated online.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nevertheless, ABC responded to the drama by temporarily pulling Amy and T.J. off the air. By early 2023, they decided to completely pull the plug on the co-hosts’ gig as a result of the highly publicized relationship drama. The two broadcast journalists eventually <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>broke their silence</a> on the situation during a December 2023 conversation on their podcast, “Amy & T.J.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/amy-robach-tj-holmes-speak-out-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I guess the best way to sum us up, Amy and T.J., is that we’re the folks who lost the jobs we love because we love each other,” T.J. noted.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Amy then recalled how she and T.J. learned that they were being fired from the network. “We each got a phone call from our bosses saying that they had made the decision — and they made it again a point to say we hadn’t violated any company policy — but because we had become a distraction that they thought it would be best if they temporarily took us off the air to let things quiet down,” she explained. “And I remember I said … ‘Now this is going to be a story if you take us off the air, please don’t do this.’ … I was sick to my stomach because we knew what was coming once that announcement was made.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Are Andrew Shue and Marilee Feibig Dating?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Just hours after T.J. and Amy broke their silence on their dramatic GMA3 firing,<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i> Page Six </i></a>reported that Marilee and Andrew have been dating for the past several months. Amy and Andrew finalized their divorce this past March, whereas Marilee and T.J. settled their divorce in October. They are reportedly due back in court in January 2024.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“It turned into something else, and they’re connected over their values. It’s bigger than the affair now,” a source told the outlet about Marilee and Andrew. “They’re not heartbroken and sad. Everyone has moved on.”</p><h2>Did Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes Cheat on Their Former Spouses?<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Despite both still being legally married to their then-spouses, multiple outlets reported that Amy and T.J. didn’t start dating until after they both separated from Marilee and Andrew. During their December podcast discussion, Amy pointed out that she and T.J. were trying to “get these divorces cleaned up” before approaching their ABC bosses about their relationship.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“We thought, in January, we’re going to go and walk in and explain to management that we are a couple … We’d actually even talked about doing it earlier,” she said. “Right before the pictures came out, we thought, ‘Should we tell them what’s going on?’ And we thought, ‘Let’s just get these divorces cleaned up and then let’s do it.’ But we had every intention of doing it and we didn’t believe, and I don’t think we still do believe, we were doing anything technically wrong.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>T.J. elaborated by noting that they didn’t cheat on anyone, saying, “To be clear, we were outed as being in a relationship, but everyone else thought we were being outed as adulterers — being outed as cheating on our spouses — and it wasn’t the case.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CrnGaZnpm%2FpsOMrJ%2BunV2Wu6V5zJqpoqSVmnqntcSboKBllJbBqrrGZq6hmaRixKZ5yqemsGVlZ314fZdpZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-andrew-shue-and-marilee-fiebig-dating-what-we-know-5207180.html&text=Are%20Andrew%20Shue%20and%20Marilee%20Fiebig%20Dating%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-andrew-shue-and-marilee-fiebig-dating-what-we-know-5207180.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-andrew-shue-and-marilee-fiebig-dating-what-we-know-5207180.html&title=Are%20Andrew%20Shue%20and%20Marilee%20Fiebig%20Dating%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-andrew-shue-and-marilee-fiebig-dating-what-we-know-5207180.html&title=Are%20Andrew%20Shue%20and%20Marilee%20Fiebig%20Dating%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-andrew-shue-and-marilee-fiebig-dating-what-we-know-5207180.html&title=Are%20Andrew%20Shue%20and%20Marilee%20Fiebig%20Dating%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-andrew-shue-and-marilee-fiebig-dating-what-we-know-5207180.html&description=Are%20Andrew%20Shue%20and%20Marilee%20Fiebig%20Dating%3f%20What%20We%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billy-eichner-seeing-real-gay-bar-on-sex-and-the-city-felt-so-radical-at-the-time-7506710.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billy Eichner Recalls Seeing Gay Bar on Sex and the City">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./olivia-flowers-dating-southern-charm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Olivia Flowers Dating on Southern Charm?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
