The rumor of him being gay started when he portrayed Elvis Presley in the movie Elvis.</p><p>After putting on makeup to look like Elvis Presley, Austin Butler appeared to some people as if he might be gay. This is because Elvis wore eye makeup and didn’t have a beard. But that’s not true.</p><p><strong>Austin Butler is actually straight and is attracted to women.</strong></p><p>Also, there was a photo of Austin Butler with <a href=#>singer Shawn Mendes</a> that made some people think something was going on between them.</p><p>But that’s not the case.</p><p>Austin and Shawn are just good friends, and that’s why they took a picture together.

Also, he sometimes wore makeup on his eyes, like eyeshadow, and he often didn’t have a beard.</p><p>All these things made people curious about whether Elvis might have liked guys or not.</p><p>But let’s focus on Austin Butler now.</p><p>Because Austin acted as Elvis so well, some people started thinking he might be gay.
