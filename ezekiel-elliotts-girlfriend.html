Furthermore, she is originally from Iowa and currently resides in Dallas.</p><p>She hasn’t updated or enclosed her family background and childhood days, including her father’s name and siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, like her boyfriend, <strong>Ezekiel Elijah Elliott,</strong> Woodard is no stranger to keeping her life low-key.</p><p>Alongside their dates and relationship, she has also kept her personal details in the shade.&nbsp;</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Halle Woodard is an academically sound lady.

Woodard doesn’t seem to use Twitter and thus, has no Twitter account.</p><p>However, her Instagram account goes by her real name Halle Woodard (<a href=#>@halle_woodard</a>), with 1.5k followers and 2.7k following.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-122.png><p>Additionally, her Instagram bio reads, “Aesthetic Nurse Injector. <a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@thenaturalrn_</a>?<br><a class=notranslate tabindex=0 href=#>@bodymachinefitness</a>.<br>Dog mom of four! ????”</p><h2>Woodard and Elliott’s Story</h2><p>The duo has been together since 2017 and has even gone through relationship obstacles together.</p><p>Indeed, their sail hasn’t been a smooth ride. They had even taken a short break from their relationship once.</p><p>During their journey, Elliott has been involved in plenty of scandals and cheating rumors; however, Woodard has been that loyal girlfriend ever.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he has been through hell waters, Woodard has been on his side supporting her boyfriend.</p><p>Not to mention, the duo had unfollowed each other on social media sites during the scandal.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Elliotts-familys-dinner-out-819x1024.jpg><p>Yes, during those tenures, Elliott was arrested for getting into a fight with a safety officer at the Electric Daisy Festival in Las Vegas.</p><p>Also, their break was almost four months until they got back together as before.</p><h3>Did the duo get engaged secretly?</h3><p>Many fans assumed Woodard and Elliott had gotten engaged or walked down the aisle after their patch-up. The news hasn’t yet been confirmed; however, it seems that they haven’t yet taken vows.&nbsp;</p><p>Logically speaking, if they had tied a knot, they would have the engagement rings, which we don’t see in their pictures.</p><p>Thus, we all can wait for their good news. Till then, fingers crossed for their happy relationship.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mother, Dawn Elliott’s Uploads</h3><p>According to the sources, Woodard first met Elliott’s parents during his six-game suspension, and then she created a deep bond with his mother.</p><p>Since their bonding, mother Elliott has been showering birthday wishes for the diva every year.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from it, she has also uploaded her pictures during their events together.

In fact, he noted that the injuries Thompson got were from her fight in the bar.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, during his interview with <strong>TMZ</strong>, Elliott stated, “She was just one of the many girls he was having sex with.”</p><p>However, the NFL gave up a different view.
