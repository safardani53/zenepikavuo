And, frankly, just a little bit, well... yuck!</p><p>Over the course of their 21-year-marriage he has given his wife a boob job, liposuction, butt “enhancements”, body-contouring surgery, waist and abdominal sculpting, Botox, cheek and lip fillers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000284074166-e1480205047855.jpg><p>The thing I found really depressing was her saying she has what she believes is the perfect body thanks to her husband’s surgical handiwork and would like more.</p><p>She said: “Phillip loves redesigning his sports cars, our furniture and, most of all, me. After having two kids, I decided to let him fine-tune me.”</p><p>Craft meanwhile sums it up as follows: “After my surgical tweaks to her body, I think she’s even more beautiful now than when I met her, aged 22”.</p><p>At best, it’s definitely more than a little bit distasteful.</p><p>But at worst, it’s bullying, controlling and sinister.</p><p>He is treating her like an object, or a Barbie doll, surgically sculpting her into “perfection”.</p><p>If I was her, I’d take the “gifts” he has given her and use them to find someone else.</p><p>Personally I think it’s her who needs the upgrade!</p><p>Annoyingly, the papers were full of similar stories over the past week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000281940463.jpg><p>One was an interview with the former Towie star Dan Osborne talking about how his partner Jacqueline Jossa doesn’t “feel sexy” since giving birth to their daughter.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine why he might have chosen to share that with the world, even if it is true.</p><p>But whatever his motivation, his comments are the opposite of loyal and seem designed mainly to further erode her confidence.</p><p>And then there was <a href=#>Ola Jordan</a>’s husband, James, revealing to the world that his dancer wife suffers from severe confidence issues regarding her weight.</p><p>“She can look at food and put on weight, whereas I’ve got a very fast metabolism. If she ate what I ate she’d balloon,” he explained in an interview. Charming.</p><p>Not only that, but he also told everyone that she was worried about going make-up free in her stint in I’m A Celebrity as she’s suffered with severe acne for the past decade, leaving scars on her face. Er, thanks a lot, James!</p><p>It’s not surprising though. Earlier this year on Loose Women, Ola revealed that James kindly tells her when she has put on weight, in a bid to help her lose it again, which sounds pretty controlling to me.</p><p>With a husband like that, who needs trolls, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict0002816871602-e1480205371851.jpg><p>And then there was an interview with Geordie Shore’s Sophie Kasaei who talked about being trolled online about her looks.</p><p>Her boyfriend Joel Corry, she said, couldn’t be more supportive.</p><p>“He’ll never say I look fat,” she declared. “But if I’m down about it and crying to him, he’ll tell me to do something about it.’</p><p>What kind of world are we living in where a woman is almost grateful that her boyfriend doesn’t call her fat?</p><p>The truth, I’m sorry to say, is that every woman battles with body insecurities.</p><p>And almost all of us are guilty of automatically asking, “Does my bum look big in this?” without wanting the true answer.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>Part of the reason is that women are still scrutinised, judged, and criticised about their bodies and their weight from dusk until dawn.</p><p>We are constantly being invited to compare ourselves to airbrushed images of “perfection”.</p><p>Far too much air time is given to who is fat and who is thin when, frankly, we should all just be getting on with our lives.</p><p>It’s just a suggestion, but ladies maybe we should stop asking whether our bum looks big and do just that!</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">DISCIPLINE IS THE ISSUE FOR ROCCO</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000214127031-e1480204673334.jpg><p>IT’S every mother’s nightmare. And this week it became a reality for Madonna when her 16-year-old son, <a href=#>Rocco, was arrested after being caught with cannabis</a>.</p><p>Also last week photos reemerged from early this year of Rocco walking around smoking and hanging around drinking alcohol under a bridge looking as if he could be homeless.</p><p>I know it’s easy to comment from the sidelines but, to me, this situation looks like a major lack of discipline.</p><p>Yes, we all know that teenagers experiment and that they like to push the boundaries.</p><p>But it’s stopping experimentation from becoming a habit that good parenting is all about and the way that you do that is to come down hard.</p><p>Sadly, Rocco looks like a boy who doesn’t have any discipline in his life.</p><p>It’s not his fault, of course, that his parents split up and had such a public custody battle and that must have been hard for him.</p><p>But maybe if he had gone to live with his mum, who seems to have a lot more discipline than his dad, he wouldn’t be hanging around under a bridge swigging from a bottle.</p><p>I hate to say it but it looks like Guy Ritchie is making the mistake of trying to be Rocco’s friend, not his parent.</p><h2>Meghan's made her Mark-le</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000214127031-e1480204673334.jpg><p>THIS week my heart belongs to <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and what she wrote in a magazine in her role as UN Women advocate:</p><p>“With fame comes opportunity, but it also includes responsibility to advocate and share, to focus less on glass slippers and more on pushing through glass ceilings.”</p><p>Who knows, of course, what will happen with her and Prince Harry?</p><p>But I can’t help thinking that she is the perfect princess for the modern day.</p><p>A breath of fresh air is just what the British monarchy needs.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">THE STING IN HIS TALE OF SUCCESS</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283973364-e1480204814897.jpg><p>DID you see the interview this week where Sting – apparently worth £200million – said he had to move to the US because Brits are so jealous about him climbing the social ladder so successfully?</p><p>Maybe all that tantric sex has gone to his head?</p><p>To be honest, until I read this article I had forgotten all about him.</p><h2>Cure for pines and needles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict0002797705516-e1480204999807.jpg><p>NOW Bonfire Night and Thanksgiving are done and dusted, there’s nothing cushioning us from Christmas.</p><p>So when is the right time to put up the tree?</p><p>If you’re a last-minute type, don’t ask Holly Willoughby, Jodie Marsh or the Osbournes all of whom have already tweeted photos of their trees in all their decorated glory.</p><p>They should take a leaf out of my book and put the tree up a week before – and take it down the day after.</p><p>I love Christmas but if you get a real tree it moults everywhere and gets on my nerves.</p><p>When it comes to mulled wine, Quality Street and Christmas pud – I’m there.</p><p>I love the spirit of Christmas, just not the tree for more than a week.</p><p><strong>— DUBAI</strong> passport control is a miserable experience. No one looks you in the eye or smiles, and no one talks to you.</p><p>Even when I had to spend an hour in a side-room while some issue with my husband’s passport got sorted – by the way, I never did discover what the issue was, as no one spoke to us – they spoke over us, to each other, but never actually to us.</p><p>Contrast this with our great island.</p><p>When I arrived in London, despite the cold, windy, miserable weather, I walked up to immigration and the chap on the desk smiled and said: “Hello, young lady.”</p><p>Young lady indeed.
