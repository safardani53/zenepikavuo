I don’t get this ‘style,’” wrote one.</p><p>Another shared: “That dress gives me ‘alien frantically pulling together a dress’.”</p><p>The mom of four has appeared in good spirits through it all, ignoring the backlash, negative comments, and more despite some personal drama playing out behind the scenes.</p><p>Her estranged husband <a href=#>Kanye West</a> launched <a href=#>a series of attacks</a> against her, her family, and those associated with her on Instagram.</p><p>She has been quiet amid the drama, saying nothing on her own social media accounts.</p><h2>KANYE'S COMMENTS</h2><p>The Chicago rapper <a href=#>kicked things off by lashing out</a> at Kim and her mom <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> in a series of bizarre posts on Instagram.</p><p>He revealed an apparent pornography addiction, called Hollywood a brothel and vowed to get "control" of his kids.</p><p>The fashion mogul posted a barrage of memes and scathing rants, all of which appear to have been deleted.</p><p>He mentioned Sierra Canyon private school in California where&nbsp;Kim has sent their children for years.</p><p>Kanye's&nbsp;<a href=#>first rant</a>&nbsp;seemed to take aim at momager Kris in particular, as he wrote: "Don’t let Kris make you do Playboy like she made Kyle and Kim do," he wrote.</p><p>"Hollywood is a giant brothel. Pornography destroyed my family.</p><p>"I deal with the addiction, Instagram promotes it."</p><p>"Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago."</p><p>The caption was posted alongside an image of an unknown woman.</p><p>In another, he accused without context over a black background:&nbsp;</p><p>"They teach black kids Kwanzaa at Sierra Canyon," he posted. "What the f**k is Kwanzaa and who made that bulls**t up?"&nbsp;</p><p>"Everyone lives in LA for the check anyway, so no one really cares about their children being indoctrinated."</p><p>Minutes later, the rapper posted a declarative follow-up.</p><p>"My kids going to Donda," he shared, presumably referring to his personal private school in nearby Simi Valley. "They not going to Sierra Canyon."</p><p>"Charlamagne Tha God and Kris get the m***king popcorn."</p><p>Not long after that, Kanye posted an unidentified text message conversation with someone not happy with his rants.</p><p>Fans speculated that the person, who begged him to "stop," was Kim.</p><p>He also mentioned "Trav, Travis, and Scott" in yet another&nbsp;<a href=#>all-black text meme then posted the NSFW google search for "c*m donors."</a></p><p>He wildly captioned that one: "Calling my fellow c*m doners We in this 2gthr."</p><p>The posts kept coming Thursday - he then shared another all-black text post that called anyone who thinks he's "spiraling", "sheep."</p><p>"Y’all not finna keep discriminating on me while the organizations use me and use us all" he jotted into the caption.</p><h2>CALL THEM IN</h2><p>He then appeared to try and <a href=#>recruit other Kardashian exes</a>, sharing a screenshot that had the names Tristan, Travis, and Scott written out.</p><p>The second slide showed the Google search results of a search for “c*m donors”.</p><p>In the caption, Kanye wrote: “Calling my fellow c*m donors. We are in this together.”</p><p>Later, Kanye <a href=#>shifted gears</a>, taking aim at Kim's ex <a href=#>Pete Davidson</a> and another famous figure: Trevor Noah.</p><p>"Ask Pete how those tattoos of my kids are doing in the trauma unit," he posted against a black background.</p><p>Kanye was referring to the&nbsp;<a href=#>tattoo on Pete's neck</a>&nbsp;that he got when he was dating&nbsp;Kim.</p><p>The tattoo reads "KNSCP" - representing the initials of Kim, and her children&nbsp;<a href=#>North</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Saint</a>, Chicago, and Psalm.</p><p>The reality star shares the four kids with Kanye, and the two were married from 2014 until they&nbsp;<a href=#>finalized their divorce</a>&nbsp;in March.</p><p>But following their split, Kanye was not happy to see his ex-wife moving on with Pete.</p><h2>LEGAL SCARE</h2><p>Kanye at one point even threatened to <a href=#>get the courts involved</a>, writing: "I was driven crazy before I'm not going crazy no more It's not up to Calabasas or Hulu where my kids go to school."</p><p>He went on: "I'm not the crazy one here. It's up!</p><p>"I won't stop until I have a say so on my kids no matter what it legally takes."</p><p>He captioned the post: "Come and get me I'm a man of God.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The father's job is to be the bad guy some times."</p><p>The rapper continued of outspoken Kanye critic, Trevor Noah: "So <a href=#>Trevor Noah</a> come speak on my family so I can be the bad guy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/www-instagram-com-p-chfafg8o62k-752735458-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/taken-without-permission-kim-kardashian-757320869-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/ef2985b8-6297-4b4f-9589-6a720ab8796d.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYWh%2BdoKQaKKipV2grrOwwKyfopmeYre2uc%2BsrKKsXZuurbjSZqafnl2ptaq6jJ%2BpmqWVYrumw4ypoJyrXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkim-kardashian-jumpsuit-falls-off-thin-frame-new-pics.html&text=Kim%20Kardashians%20plunging%20jumpsuit%20nearly%20falls%20off%20her%20thin%20frame%20as%20she%20shows%20off%20skinnier-than-&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkim-kardashian-jumpsuit-falls-off-thin-frame-new-pics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashian-jumpsuit-falls-off-thin-frame-new-pics.html&title=Kim%20Kardashians%20plunging%20jumpsuit%20nearly%20falls%20off%20her%20thin%20frame%20as%20she%20shows%20off%20skinnier-than-" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkim-kardashian-jumpsuit-falls-off-thin-frame-new-pics.html&title=Kim%20Kardashians%20plunging%20jumpsuit%20nearly%20falls%20off%20her%20thin%20frame%20as%20she%20shows%20off%20skinnier-than-" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkim-kardashian-jumpsuit-falls-off-thin-frame-new-pics.html&title=Kim%20Kardashians%20plunging%20jumpsuit%20nearly%20falls%20off%20her%20thin%20frame%20as%20she%20shows%20off%20skinnier-than-" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkim-kardashian-jumpsuit-falls-off-thin-frame-new-pics.html&description=Kim%20Kardashians%20plunging%20jumpsuit%20nearly%20falls%20off%20her%20thin%20frame%20as%20she%20shows%20off%20skinnier-than-" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lynette-nusbacher-mysteries-of-the-abandoned.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lynette Nusbacher From 'Mysteries of the Abandoned' Is Knowledgeable AF">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./plus-size-jeggings-try-on-supermarkets.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Im plus-size &amp;amp; tried on jeggings from different supermarkets - from M&amp;amp;S to Tesco &amp;amp; Asda, who took">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
