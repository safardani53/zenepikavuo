The Morning Show, created by Jay Carson, starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell in the major roles. The show debuted on November 1, 2019, and has now aired for two seasons. The series depicts the narrative of The Morning Program, a prominent morning news show, and its hosts. Alex Levy (Aniston) and Mitch Kessler (Carell) are seen hosting the program for the previous 15 years, growing it to what it is now. When Kessler is ousted in a sexual misconduct controversy, Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon), who was just hired, takes over. Her attitude, however, is radically different, and she disagrees with Alex.</p><p>Reese Witherspoon is the new generation journalist who introduces Alex, the old guard, to an entirely new world of journalism. She has even been nominated for an Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama Series. Here, we look at some of the most fascinating facts and insights regarding Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.&nbsp;An unusual family background, past projects, and more – here are 5 fun facts about The Morning Show actress Reese Witherspoon.</p><h2>1) Reese Witherspoon’s path to stardom</h2><p>Reese Witherspoon began performing when she was seven years old. She got hooked on acting after appearing in a commercial for a flower store owned by the dad of one of her friends. Soon after, she began attending acting courses and set her sights on being a famous actor. By the time she was eleven, she had won a 10-State Talent Award competition, which landed her further employment in the following years.</p><p>She began earning acting jobs by the time she was thirteen. This was quickly followed by her first big-screen appearance, in the feature picture The Man in the Moon.&nbsp;She went to an audition for extras in the film with her pals when she was 14 years old. But she got the casting directors’ attention and was flown to Los Angeles to audition for the starring part, which she won.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Reese-Witherspoon-1.jpg alt="Reese Witherspoon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She was a great achiever from an early age and had outstanding marks, which helped her get admission to Stanford for an undergraduate degree in English Literature. She did, however, leave her degree unfinished in order to pursue a full-time acting career.</p><h2>2) She comes from an unusual family tree.</h2><p>The first thing to note is that her entire name is Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon, not Reese Witherspoon. She discarded her first two names to seem more appropriate for Hollywood.&nbsp;Her parents are both doctors, and she describes herself as a “dork” who dropped out of college to pursue a career in movies. Another fascinating detail about her family is that they are descended from one of America’s founding fathers, John Witherspoon. He was a preacher who represented New Jersey in the Continental Congress and was a signatory to the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America.</p><h2>3) Reese Witherspoon is a novelist.</h2><p>While she did not finish her English Literature degree, her admission to Stanford demonstrates her intellectual ability. Although she has largely worked in the film business, she has also dabbled in other fields, one of which is writing. Reese Witherspoon has written a book.&nbsp;In 2018, she released her first book, Whiskey in a Teacup: What Growing Up in the South Taught Me About Life, Love, and Baking Biscuits. Busy Betty, her debut children’s book, is set to be released on October 4, 2022. The following is the book’s synopsis:</p><p>Busy Betty has always had a lot on her plate. . . even when she was a newborn! Betty knows Frank urgently needs a wash after giving him a hearty embrace. Betty’s closest friend, Mae, is coming over, and she can’t have the stinkiest dog in the world! But giving Frank a bath is more difficult than she anticipated, and just when everything seems impossible, Betty discovers that with dedication, collaboration, and one brilliant idea, she can do anything.</p><h2>4) Her additional business endeavors</h2><p>Reese Witherspoon is an Academy Award-winning actress and novelist, as well as a producer and the proprietor of her own clothes and fashion home décor company. Seth Rodsky co-owns her production business, Hello Sunshine, which focuses on creating women-centric stories across numerous media.&nbsp;In 2015, Witherspoon founded Draper James, a retail business named after her grandparents. The company specializes in women’s fashion, including apparel and accessories, as well as stationery and home décor inspired by the American South.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Reese-Witherspoon-2.jpg alt="Reese Witherspoon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>All of her business enterprises, along with her brilliant acting career, have elevated her to the ranks of the industry’s most successful performers. With an estimated $400 million net worth, Forbes ranked her the world’s wealthiest actress in 2021.</p><h2>5) Singing makes her terribly uneasy, yet she still does it.</h2><p>Reese Witherspoon’s 2005 film Walk the Line, in which she co-starred with Joaquin Phoenix, was one of her most memorable efforts. She portrayed June Carter Cash, Johnny Cash’s second wife, and singer-songwriter. She had to sing in front of a live audience for the part.&nbsp;Despite her fears, she underwent six months of voice training to prepare for the role, which earned her an Academy Award, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and a SAG Award for her powerful performance.&nbsp;Although singing isn’t her finest skill, she stepped outside of her comfort zone once again to perform a duet of Somethin’ Stupid with Michael Bublé for his 2013 album To Be Loved.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGhsZqGeqbKzsdKtoKefXZuupMDSZpibp6WperW0xGakqKqenruoedKhprCrXaeypr%2FEZq6irJiav7S8zqilaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f5-interesting-facts-about-the-morning-shows-reese-witherspoon.html&text=5%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20The%20Morning%20Shows%20Reese%20Witherspoon&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f5-interesting-facts-about-the-morning-shows-reese-witherspoon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f5-interesting-facts-about-the-morning-shows-reese-witherspoon.html&title=5%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20The%20Morning%20Shows%20Reese%20Witherspoon" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f5-interesting-facts-about-the-morning-shows-reese-witherspoon.html&title=5%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20The%20Morning%20Shows%20Reese%20Witherspoon" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f5-interesting-facts-about-the-morning-shows-reese-witherspoon.html&title=5%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20The%20Morning%20Shows%20Reese%20Witherspoon" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f5-interesting-facts-about-the-morning-shows-reese-witherspoon.html&description=5%20Interesting%20Facts%20About%20The%20Morning%20Shows%20Reese%20Witherspoon" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexa-marie-aikman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexa Marie Aikman Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-katrina-weidman-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Katrina Weidman Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
