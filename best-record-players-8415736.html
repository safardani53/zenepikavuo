We love that the tonearm on this player is semi-automatic. It delivers the hands-on, manual experience of starting a record with <strong>less likelihood of scratching</strong> your beloved vinyl collection.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Semi-automatic means you place the tonearm to start a record, but a specially counterbalanced mechanism drops the needle gently and perfectly in place. An anti-skating system protects the record from potential needle scratches, and the auto-stop feature prevents unnecessary wear of your needle.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The solidly built plinth or base of this player <strong>reduces vibrations</strong> and produces a <strong>smoother sound</strong>. A built-in preamp allows you to connect to external speakers with ease and provides the opportunity to integrate this player into future upgraded sound systems. The turntable is available in black, white, and walnut (our favorite). It’s a great choice for homes of various types of listeners —&nbsp;from vinyl novices to seasoned musicians.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>13.75 x 16.5 x 5.5 inches <strong>| Speakers: </strong>None<strong> | Operational Mode: </strong>Semi-Automatic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-crosley-electronics-c6-vinyl-record-player-with-wireless-bluetooth></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crosley Electronics C6 Vinyl Record Player with wireless Bluetooth</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Crosley Electronics C6 Vinyl Record Player with wireless Bluetooth" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/H6gH7d-HL_A4YtnW86d58klDgeA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/crosley-c6b-ma-belt-drive-bluetooth-turntable-record-player-with-adjustable-tone-arm-mahogany-491278a996bf4da69e1150c929d67d44.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Crosley C6 Vinyl Record Player offers high quality with a slightly lower price tag. It <strong>comes with Bluetooth capability</strong> and can easily connect with speakers you already own. Since it isn’t attached to any specific speakers it allows for upgrades to your speaker set-up over time. It comes with a <strong>built-in preamp</strong> that’s user-friendly for all levels. And its <strong>sleek and minimal design</strong> allows it to blend in with any room aesthetic. For a quality manual, two-speed turntable, this price can’t be beat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>14.25 x 16.5 x 5 inches<strong> | Speakers: </strong>None<strong> | Operational Mode: </strong>Manual</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-portable-victrola-revolution-go></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Portable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Victrola Revolution GO</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Victrola Revolution GO" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ubIVVZHZ3JIn6EFWTyZ3CL9HfBE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Victrola-Revolution-GO-ea351c0d9bfa47ec8f1bf55f2cd94c9b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Best Buy</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now you can take your records with you wherever you want to set the mood. The Victrola Revolution GO is our favorite portable record player. It is a rechargeable, battery-operated record player that’s truly <strong>easy to transport</strong>. This player not only delivers the convenience of mobility but also features <strong>Bluetooth capability </strong>and<strong> built-in stereo speakers</strong>. You can enjoy 12 hours of cordless listening with this player.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that it comes in fun, bright colors in addition to classic black. The record player is more about the experience than just the quality of the sound. It’s great for novices and vinyl aficionados alike. “If I go to my backyard, I love to have an outdoor vinyl experience with my Revolution GO and a few of my favorite albums,” shares Inman. A detachable guitar strap helps with portability, and the lid is removable to showcase the vinyl you’ve brought along.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions: </strong>12.99 X 12.83 X 4.84 inches <strong>| Speakers: </strong>Built-in<strong> | Operational Mode: </strong>Manual</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sonos-sonos-pro-ject-t1></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Sonos</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sonos Pro-Ject T1</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sonos Pro-Ject T1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ktRk4jJM2OeNfGzIYdVY6fG63E0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sonos-Pro-Ject-T1-2dd5fb16c62b4a28bf04a4cec7ecd41e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sonos</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking to integrate a record player into your existing Sonos setup at home? Look no further than Sonos’s own Pro-Ject T1. This sleek and slim turntable will blend in seamlessly.

It’s perfect for small spaces that lack room for a more involved set-up with external speakers. It also has Bluetooth capability and an <strong>auxiliary input port to connect other devices</strong>.

The Victrola Navigator will be a conversation-starter in any room. This player is a one-stop-shop for all your retro listening needs. It includes a <strong>turntable</strong>, <strong>CD player</strong>, <strong>cassette player</strong>, an <strong>FM radio</strong>, and <strong>built-in speakers</strong>. Plus, bluetooth capability allows you to play music — like your favorite Dolly Parton albums —from other devices.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The turntable has <strong>3 speeds for varying record sizes</strong>. If you want to add speakers down the line, you’ll need to purchase an amplifier, as this one doesn’t have a built-in preamp.

This two-speed record player comes with a pre-amp for easy connection to external speakers.

Its direct drive allows for <strong>more precise speed control and torque</strong> — perfect for DJing and high-fidelity listening. Davis still has his 1200 series from the 90s, so you know these are built to last. “It’s the classic DJ deck from that era,” he says. “It's got direct drive and is really solidly built with a good cartridge and preamp — sounds great for any music.

A manual record player requires the user to place the needle on the record and take it off. An automatic record player moves the needle on its own at a press of a button to start or stop the record. Semi-automatic record players blend both modes. They require you to move the needle to start the record but can drop the needle on their own. They may also lift the needle at the end of the record.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.91534391534392><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best Bluetooth record player?</span></p><p>Our favorite Bluetooth record player is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Sony PS-LX310BT.</a> It’s made of high-quality components, delivers great sound, and comes in under $200.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Does a good record player make a difference?</span></p><p>A good record player can make all the difference in your vinyl listening experience.
