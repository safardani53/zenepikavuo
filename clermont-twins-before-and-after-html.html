The youngest of a middle-class family, Shannade and Shannon carved their way to success themselves, and&nbsp;they have kept going&nbsp;despite a few lapses.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Are Clermont Twins?</h2><p>Shannade and Shannon were born on March 21, 1994, in Montclair, New Jersey. Their parents, both middle-class immigrants, raised them and their three older siblings (two brothers and one sister) in two places.</p><p>Their mother, a Jamaican, ran a daycare, and their father, a man from Haiti, owned and ran a moving company. Other than these, they have Indian and Chinese heritage as well.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After spending their first nine years in Montclair, the <a href=# rel="follow noopener">family&nbsp;moved</a> to Dallas, Georgia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>The Clermont Twins with their family.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Their parents&nbsp;always wanted their children to understand the importance of hard work and good academic performance. There were no talks about fame and glamor in the household. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Shannade and Shannon, however, wanted to have a more glam-filled life. It was an interest they developed because of their aunt, who would take them to fashion shows in New York and make her own clothes.</p><p>With this influence running strong, they both attended fashion schools. Shannade attended&nbsp;Parsons School of Design in Lower Manhattan, New York City, while Shannon went to The Fashion Institute of Technology. They both graduated in 2016.</p><p>But&nbsp;their lives took a turn for the better in 2015. That year, they appeared in Bad Girls Club as "bad girls." They were kicked off the show halfway through, but that only did wonders for their careers in the entertainment business. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Soon came a music video gig with rapper <a href=# rel=follow>Future</a>. And they got the <a href=# rel=follow>Kanye</a> approval, appearing on his Yeezy Season 6 campaign as doubles for <a href=# rel=follow>Kim Kardashian</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>2017 saw the twins combine their sense of fashion and business. They started Mont Boudoir, their clothing line, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">later added</a> eyewear to their collection in 2019. This came on the backs of their&nbsp;Saint Laurent and Sherri Hill internships.</p><p>The beginning of that same year, however, would start a nightmare Shannade came to terms with years later. A nightmare that left one dead and her in jail for a while.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Shannade Clermont’s Jail Time and Lapses in Career</h2><p>On January 31, 2017, Shannade went on a "prostitution date" with real estate broker&nbsp;James Alesi. That night, after Shannade left, he died of a drug overdose.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But, it would later come out that Shannade did not just leave him. She also took Alesi's, who she described as her "sugar daddy," card and the necessary information to use his money.</p><p>The fashion influencer then spent $20 thousand of his money over the next few months on fashion supplies for herself, all the while not knowing Alesi was dead. These would all come to bite her in the back in 2018.</p><p>In July 2018, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she was arrested</a> for one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and one count of access device fraud, and aggravated identity theft. 24 at the time of her arrest, Shannade potentially faced decades in prison if found guilty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In November, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pleaded guilty</a> and awaited sentencing in April 2019. The sentence she was given was less than initially expected but more than the sisters expected — <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a year in prison</a> and over $5,000 in restitution.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Aside from the pain of having to go to jail, the case presented the twins with another difficulty. They had to reject a lot of modeling offers between November 2018 and April 2019, and their brand image stalled.</p><p>Shannade turned herself in on June 4, 2019, and was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released</a> from&nbsp;Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin&nbsp;(FCI Dublin), a low-security prison in Los Angeles, on March 9, 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They relaunched their brand in June 2020, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">adding eyewear</a> to their collection, and have since been going strong.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>They have constantly evolved their sense of style and appearance, even undergoing plastic surgery on their lips, cheeks, chin, and buttocks — basically everywhere except their breasts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Both of them were subjected to a lot of internet trolling and ridicule after Shannade's conviction. However, they kept their heads up and persevered. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Now, they have a fashion empire of their own. The social media influencers, who boast around 1.8 million Instagram followers, lead a fashion brand that caters to their niche audience.</p><p>Following Shannade's release from prison and the turmoil the family went through during and before her imprisonment, the twins also started The Clermont Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to mental health awareness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJucmr%2Buu82tZK2vmaPAbq7En6arnV2Wu6V5wJ%2BrnqpencGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fclermont-twins-before-and-after-html.html&text=Who%20Are%20Clermont%20Twins%3f%20A%20Look%20at%20Their%20Lives%20Before%20and%20After%20Fame&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclermont-twins-before-and-after-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclermont-twins-before-and-after-html.html&title=Who%20Are%20Clermont%20Twins%3f%20A%20Look%20at%20Their%20Lives%20Before%20and%20After%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fclermont-twins-before-and-after-html.html&title=Who%20Are%20Clermont%20Twins%3f%20A%20Look%20at%20Their%20Lives%20Before%20and%20After%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fclermont-twins-before-and-after-html.html&title=Who%20Are%20Clermont%20Twins%3f%20A%20Look%20at%20Their%20Lives%20Before%20and%20After%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclermont-twins-before-and-after-html.html&description=Who%20Are%20Clermont%20Twins%3f%20A%20Look%20at%20Their%20Lives%20Before%20and%20After%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-kim-jones-married-to-know-about-his-affairs-and-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Kim Jones Married to?
