She sees it as an essential aspect of her life. The American politician is now serving as Arkansas’s 47th governor. Sarah was elected as the state’s first female governor after defeating Democrat Chris Jones and Libertarian Richy Dale Harrington Jr. From 2017 through 2019, the former political spokesman served as President Trump’s 31st White House press secretary.</p><h2>Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s Religion: Is She Christian?</h2><p><strong>Huckabee Sanders</strong> is a practicing Christian. She identifies as a Southern Baptist in particular. She may not discuss God in public very much, but she strongly believes in Him. People who have worked with her on campaigns claim she would recite a pre-event prayer on a regular basis.</p><p>Sarah’s Christian life shows the movement away from denominations among younger evangelicals. Sarah is a Southern Baptist, although she has visited more mainstream evangelical congregations. Bryan Sanders, her husband, is not merely a devout Catholic; their three children were baptized as newborns. According to a family member, the pair are “progressive Christians.” Every Sunday, they attend evangelical and Catholic churches.&nbsp;Sarah discussed how her Christian faith connects with her job at Baptist Press. She said that religion is an important aspect of her life and that she wants to convey it despite her political position.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sarah-Huckabee-Sanders-1.jpg alt="Sarah Huckabee Sanders" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She feels that religion and labor cannot be separated. “If you are a deep-rooted Christian, your faith defines you,” she said.&nbsp;Sarah, whose father is a retired Southern Baptist preacher, has mostly depended on her religion through tough and tragic moments.&nbsp;“I think your faith can help you get through the good and bad days,” she continued.</p><h2>Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s Husband And Children</h2><p><strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> is married to Bryan Sanders, whom she met during her father’s presidential campaign in 2008 when Bryan worked as a media consultant and she was the field director.&nbsp;The pair dated for a time before getting married in 2010. Scarlett Wiles Sanders, William Huckabee Sanders, and George Sanders are their three children.</p><p>Their two boys, William and George, are nine and seven years old, respectively, while their daughter Scarlett is 10.&nbsp;Bryan Sanders works as a campaign consultant for the Republican Party. In 2016, he and Sarah co-founded Second Street Strategies, a consulting business. Bryan, a Maine native, formerly served as the Campaign Manager for Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley (R) in 2010 and as a media consultant for Ted Yoho’s 2012 U.S. House campaign.</p><h2>Sarah Huckabee’s Family And Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Sarah Elizabeth Huckabee Sanders</strong> was born in Hope, Arkansas. She is the only child and youngest child of politicians Mike Huckabee and Janet Huckabee (née McCain). Her parents were high school sweethearts who met at Arkansas’ Hope High School. Sarah Huckabee has two brothers, John Mark, and David Huckabee.</p><p>Dorsey Wiles Huckabee (1923-1996) and Mae Elder Huckabee (1925-1999) are both conservative Southern Democrats.&nbsp;Similarly, her maternal grandparents are Angus Bouie McCain, an oilfield worker, and Pat Potter McCain, a businesswoman and politician.&nbsp;Sarah Sanders had an early interest in politics and governance as a result of her familial background. In an afternoon interview, she quipped that her intense interest in politics “doesn’t make me sound like a very fun 7-year-old.”&nbsp;Sarah attended Little Rock Central High School before attending Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, her father’s alma school.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sarah-Huckabee-Sanders-2.jpg alt="Sarah Huckabee Sanders" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She was elected President of the University’s Student Body and was engaged in Republican groups. Sarah earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2004 with a major in political science and a minor in mass communications.&nbsp;Through her father, she is an American national of English, German, and Scots-Irish ancestry. According to Ethnicelebs, she also has distant Welsh, Dutch, and French Huguenot ancestors.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqqRnXqpwcKkmJudlWLAorrDnqmsZaeeuKp51qGYratdnba0ecStn6ehk57BunnGqK2eqp6kv26%2BxKWgoKGfo3qiusNmnZqlmaHGcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsarah-huckabee-sanders-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-governor-religion-and-family.html&text=Sarah%20Huckabee%20Sanders%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Governor%20Religion%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsarah-huckabee-sanders-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-governor-religion-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsarah-huckabee-sanders-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-governor-religion-and-family.html&title=Sarah%20Huckabee%20Sanders%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Governor%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsarah-huckabee-sanders-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-governor-religion-and-family.html&title=Sarah%20Huckabee%20Sanders%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Governor%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsarah-huckabee-sanders-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-governor-religion-and-family.html&title=Sarah%20Huckabee%20Sanders%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Governor%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsarah-huckabee-sanders-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-governor-religion-and-family.html&description=Sarah%20Huckabee%20Sanders%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Governor%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-few-things-ok-more-than-a-few-to-love-about-the-new-mazda-3-sport-lux.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A few things (more than a few, actually) to love about the new Mazda 3 Sport LUX">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-koman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Koman">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
