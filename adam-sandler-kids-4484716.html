He and Jackie met on the set of the 1999 comedy and hit it off immediately. Four years after that first encounter, the two tied the knot at <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dick Clark</a></strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>’s oceanfront Malibu home</a>. A few years after saying “I do,” Adam became a big daddy in real life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Adam called his daughters “two of the true best things” in his life when he accepted the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2023 Mark Twain Prize</a>. “They are the love of our lives. The most pride and joy that Jackie and I could ever feel. The life changers,” he said in his speech. “When they speak, we either laugh, tear up, or stare at them in amazement. I’m only wishing time will stand still cause being with you two and mommy is the best life can get.” Here’s what you need to know about Adam Sandler’s daughters.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Adam and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his entire family</a> star in the Netflix movie&nbsp;You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah, which dropped on August 25. Adam plays Danny Friedman, a father to two daughters, Ronnie and Stacy, who are notably played by his real-life daughters. His wife, Jackie, also stars in the film and takes on the role of Gabi Rodriguez. The film has received critical acclaim. Since the movie is sure to be a streaming hit, get to know Adam’s daughters.</p><h2>Sadie Madison Sandler</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sadie Sandler is the oldest of Adam and Jackie’s daughters. Sadie was born on May 6, 2006. “You know what was funny?” Adam told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Access</a> in 2006, shortly after he became a dad. “When my kid was born, I was so nervous. I didn’t know what I felt. Five minutes later, maybe 10 minutes later, it was me and the kid and a nurse. We walked down alone to just check the vital signs and all that stuff, and I had a chemical reaction in my body, where I loved the kid so much, and I was so nervous for her, and that’s when I lost my mind for the kid.” Adam also said that he was doing his best to help out Jackie during the first few weeks of parenthood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adam-Sandler-kids-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“My kids give me the most joy,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HuffPost</a> in 2014. “But there are life adjustments. I don’t go out to meet anyone after 9:30 at night. I eat dinner at 6 or 7. If someone makes me stay out until 10:30 at night, I’m angry the entire next day because I’m exhausted.” Whatever Hollywood lifestyle Adam had, it went out the door in 2006 — and hasn’t come back. But he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In 2019, Adam appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> and revealed he started to feel anxiety that Sadie, 12 years old at the time, was starting to date. “You know, I drive around with [her and] her friends, and I hear them talking about boys now,” he said. “It’s amazing, the feelings I had about the same boys five years ago. When they would mention the kid’s name, I’d be like, ‘I love that kid.’ Now, I get very jumpy.” Adam admitted that he now feared boys with “little tiny mustaches” and bodies that “aren’t making much sense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/adam-sandler-kids-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sadie stars as Ronnie Friedman, the oldest of Danny and Brie Friedman’s kids, in You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah. Her next role is in the Netflix animated movie Leo, which also stars her famous family. The movie will be released on November 21, 2023.</p><h2>Sunny Madeline Sandler</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Two years after welcoming Sadie into their lives, Adam and Jackie became parents for a second time. <strong>Sunny Sandler </strong>was born on November 2, 2008. The couple has raised their children in Los Angeles, though in 2021, the Sandlers made a few appearances in Long Island while Adam was in town shooting a movie. First, Adam was <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>turned away</a> from a local International House of Pancakes, and then, he joined a random game of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pickup basketball</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Sunny-Sadler-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-11>In 2017, Adam told <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> that his kids don’t really like his movies. Though many of his films are not appropriate for minors (his daughters were 8 and 10 years old at the time), some of the PG-13ish movies are fair game. Unfortunately, they don’t hold the girls’ attention. “I’ll put them on because they beg to see them,” Adam explained. “They’re like, ‘Please, it’s not fair! Let me watch your movies. Those people always yell things at you on the street. I don’t know what the heck they’re talking about.’ So I show them the movies—they demand this—and they get, every time, I’d say about 20 minutes in, and then I see them tuning out, and then I hear them. They’re nervous to say it, but like, ‘Can we watch something else?’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sadie</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sunny</a> have a burgeoning film career of their own. Adam’s kids have had roles in his movies, including The Wrong Missy, Murder Mystery, Blended, Jack And Jill, &nbsp;the Hotel Transylvania series, the Grown Ups movies, Pixels, The Do-Over, and Sandy Wexler. In 2020, they appeared as Danielle and Cooky, respectively, in Hubie Halloween.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“You would think the kids would be very excited to be in a movie,” Adam said during an October 2020 appearance on<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Drew Barrymore Show</a>. “By around, I’d say if they were in a movie and they get to set at 8, I’d say around 9:20, I’m hearing, ‘How much more?! Please let me leave!’ They make it look like I’m forcing them to do it. Meanwhile, they were asking me the whole damn year, ‘Can I be in your next movie, Daddy?'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adam-Sandler-kids-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>“I hide ’em out in my trailer. They hang out; they’ve got their friends anyways,” added Adam. “And then I knock on the door and go, ‘They’re ready, let’s go.’ And they’re like, ‘They’re ready?!’ They always play crazy, like they didn’t know they were shooting a movie. I go, ‘You don’t have your makeup on?!’ They’re like, ‘No, I’ll do it now!’” Adam also said that he often hears his daughters say they want to be in a movie (“I say, ‘You are, you were in this, this and this.’), but the girls want to do their own films. “I go, ‘Oh, Daddy’s not good enough?’ They wanna do their own thing one day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Sunny has also shown that she has an affinity for music. She sang “A Million Dreams” from The Greatest Showman during one of Adam’s comedy shows in June 2019. Later that year, both sisters sang <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s “Lover” for a charity performance, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “Thank you for being so nice to them,” Adam told the crowd, which contained some A-listers like <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Courteney Cox</a></strong>, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rami Malek</a></strong>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong></a>. “They were dying to be a part of it,” added Adam. “Girls, you did great! Sounded awesome — confident and cool. I love you, now get out of here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/adam-sandler-kids-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Sunny <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>celebrated her Bat Mitzvah</a> in May 2022 with a candy-themed party at the&nbsp;Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles. The guest list included famous faces like <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Lautner</strong></a>, TikToker <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Josh Richards</strong></a>, and former Jessie&nbsp;cast members like&nbsp;<strong>Peyton List&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>S</strong><strong>ophie Reynolds</strong>. <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Charlie Puth</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Halsey</a>&nbsp;</strong>both performed at the star-studded event.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>In 2023, Sunny starred in the Netflix movie The Out-Laws with <strong>Adam DeVine</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pierce Brosnan</strong></a>, and more. Adam’s youngest daughter has a total breakout moment as Stacy in her latest movie, You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah. The movie revolves around Stacy and her best friend, Lydia. Ahead of their bat mitzvahs, a boy and Hebrew school drama come between their friendship. Like the rest of the Sandler family, Sunny also stars in the upcoming animated Netflix film Leo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CdmKZlo5a7pbjEq2SkoZSoenWAl21uam5f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fadam-sandler-kids-4484716.html&text=Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadam-sandler-kids-4484716.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadam-sandler-kids-4484716.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fadam-sandler-kids-4484716.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fadam-sandler-kids-4484716.html&title=Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadam-sandler-kids-4484716.html&description=Everything%20You%20Need%20To%20Know%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./identities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Harold Paz net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./erling-haaland-boots-nike-adidas-puma-man-city.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erling Haaland at centre of three-way boot sponsorship deal between Nike, Adidas and Puma - wearing ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
