His cause of death is unknown since local officials have not stated anything. However, various reports have suggested that he died as a result of a drug overdose.&nbsp;On Thursday, December 22, the story went viral, and the first musician to respond was Gucci Mane, who uploaded a couple of photographs of Scarr and wrote:</p><p>“This was excruciating. I’m missing you, @bigscarr.”</p><p>Several other celebrities, like DJ Akademiks, have also responded to the news on social media. He was supposed to appear on the Key Glock Glockoma tour from March to April 2023, according to his last recent Instagram post. Scarr also said that tickets were already available for purchase.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Scarr-1.jpg alt="Big Scarr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Netizens pay homage to Big Scarr on Twitter after his tragic death.</h2><p>He was a rising star in the music business, also known as Alexander Woods, who managed to create a large audience in a short period of time. As word of his tragic demise spread on the internet, Twitter fans paid their respects to the rapper:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>RIP Big Scarr 🙏🏽 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/n2b58icRcX</a></p><p>— 𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒄𝒌☆𝒌𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒊 (@flexxico) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 23, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Nobody was doing this on a beat man Rip Big scarr 💔 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t32sv2dndX</a></p><p>— Nick🗡️ (@yrnskill) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 23, 2022</a></p><h2>Big Scarr’s first mixtape, Big Grim Reaper, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200.</h2><p>Throughout his career, Big Scarr never recorded a solo album. He did, however, work on a few albums with other performers. He began his career with the track Make a Play, which was well-received by audiences despite his inexperience in the business. In 2020, the rapper signed with 1017 Records and released another song under the label, SolcyBoyz, in 2021. This was followed by the second and third portions of the single. Scarr’s debut mixtape, Big Grim Reaper, was released in April of last year. It peaked at number one on the Billboard 200. Frozone, I Would Keep Goin’, Traphouse, and Joe Dirt are among his other big songs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Big-Scarr.jpg alt="Big Scarr" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He also appeared as a guest on the album Love Me Like I’m Dead. From 2020 to 2022, the rapper also released five compilation albums: So Icy Summer, So Icy Gang, Vol.1, So Icy Boyz, So Icy Gang: The ReUp, So Icy Boyz 22, and So Icy Boyz: The Finale.&nbsp;Big Scarr was reared by his grandmother and never disclosed anything about his parents. He was one of eight siblings. Pooh Shiesty, his cousin, is a rapper renowned for his mixtape Shiesty Season and tracks such as Hell Night, Choppa Talk, Monday to Sunday, Twerksum, Neighbors, and others.</p><h2>Several rappers were killed in horrible incidents this year.</h2><p>The year 2022 is coming to a close. However, the year was not as successful for the hip-hop business, since it saw the loss of many outstanding musicians.&nbsp;Takeoff, who was killed last month, was the most recent victim. The event occurred at a bowling alley in Texas, and by the time police arrived, the artist had died. A nurse from a local hospital had already arrived on the scene. Two additional people had non-life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;Other names on the list include Young Slo-Be, JayDaYoungan, Rollie Bands, Money Gang Vontae, FBG Cash, Trouble, Hypo, Snootie Wild, and others.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZop9dqLCivtFmp5qro5qxbq3WmrBmmaRiwamxjJqenmWfm3pzfo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html&text=Big%20Scarr%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2022&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html&title=Big%20Scarr%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2022" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html&title=Big%20Scarr%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2022" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html&title=Big%20Scarr%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2022" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-scarr-passed-away-at-the-age-of-22.html&description=Big%20Scarr%20Passed%20Away%20At%20The%20Age%20Of%2022" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sonny-with-a-chance-cast-then-and-now-photos-4323424.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Demi Lovato &amp;amp; More  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./aomczu7gloskeyq9oszv29sxtkubqelh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Concacaf Nations League: Martinique vs. El Salvador">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
