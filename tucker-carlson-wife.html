He is known as a super conservative political voice and has hosted Tucker Carlson Tonight since 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent episode, he said that the New York Times had his private home address and had threatened to leak it in an upcoming article, thereby endangering his family, which includes Tucker Carlson’s wife and four kids.</p><p>It led to his viewers posting the address of the New York Times writer on Twitter and it became a huge mess that Tucker is at the center of. But after mentioning the safety of his family on TV and his concern for them, some people may be wondering who they are since they seem to live a fairly private life, despite Tucker's Fox News show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Tucker Carlson’s wife?</h2><p>Although Tucker is a TV news commentator and was an author and journalist in the past, his family life is kept on the down-low. However, in 2000, he and his wife, Susan Andrews spoke to People about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their long-lasting romance</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>They met when they were in high school and, Susan told the outlet of Tucker, "He was in his khaki pants and ribbon belt and I thought, even then, he seemed so optimistic and positive."</p><p>At the time, Susan spoke highly of her husband and his ability to instill patriotism to their young children. She called him "imaginative" and seemed to basically swoon over him, despite having already been together for the majority of their respective lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, there isn't much known about Tucker's wife, but given his stance on hot button political topics, it might be the way he intends to keep it, as it could be a way to shield his family from any public backlash he may receive.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tucker responds to intrusive reporting by The New York Times. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xj4z69G9cA</a></p>— Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) <a href=#>July 21, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tucker Carlson was targeted at his home once before.</h2><p>In 2018, Tucker got word before his live show that protesters had posted up at his house, where his wife was home alone, and were pounding on his front door. A group of around 20 people who were from the organization <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Smash Racism D.C.</u></a> called Tucker racist and chanted from outside his home, despite him not being there, "Tucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!"</p><p>Since then, Tucker and his family moved, and it could be part of the reason why his wife doesn't seem to have much of a social media presence, if any at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, they try to keep their family life private, so as not to draw similar attention to where they live and possibly get targeted by protesters once again.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Planned Parenthood has turned to taxpayers during the pandemic. 37 different Planned Parenthood affiliates applied for, and received, loans from the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program.

The lawsuit alleges sexual misconduct, rape, and harassment.</p><p>Tucker is one of the other names in the suit and has been accused of sexual misconduct.
