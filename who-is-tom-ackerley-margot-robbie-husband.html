"My husband is in the Harry Potter movies. I know, I was like, 'Had you told me sooner we would've been married very quickly,' " Robbie joked. "But he was an extra when he was a little kid — he was one of the Slytherin extras when Draco pushes some kids out of the way to see Buckbeak in the third book.

Robbie starred in the war-romance film alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michelle Williams</a>. At the time, Robbie was not looking for a relationship when "the best-looking guy in London" caught her eye, as she recalled to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Vogue</a> in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was the ultimate single gal.

Don't make it weird, Margot. Don't be stupid and tell him that you like him. And then it happened, and I was like, Of course we're together.

"If we can be a company that curates new and emerging talent, and can bring them through and provide that platform to do bigger movies and studio movies, that's ideally what we want to do," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robbie added: "It's nice to be in business with people where I already know we're going to do life together anyway."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 2023, LuckyChap via Robbie was awarded producer of the year at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety’s 2023 Power of Women gala</a>. The actress, who had lost her voice, asked Ackerley and McNamara to read her acceptance speech to the audience. Unbeknownst to them, Robbie wrote some hilarious anecdotes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The three of us met on a film set in Belgium 10 years ago," Ackerley said. "I was the third AD, Josey was the second AD and Margot had a small supporting role." McNamara chimed in: "And a hideous wig."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Yep. That wig was awful.

There were times we were sitting in a car parked in Atlanta freezing cold being like, 'We should be on a beach right now. We should be on a honeymoon. What are we doing?!' Following our dream," Robbie explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Extra</a> in 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once the movie wrapped, they did have time for a getaway together. "We did it after we finished shooting. It was great," she said of their honeymoon in Tahiti.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robbie later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>discussed their trip</a> during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2018, as the newlyweds had actually run into Degeneres and her wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Portia de Rossi</a> in Tahiti — along with former President <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Barack Obama</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress recounted the hilarious interaction, explaining that during a rainy day, she and Ackerley decided to head to the hotel's gym, and Ackerley threw on a pair of somewhat revealing shorts. "I was like, 'You cannot wear those shorts! They're like… you know, I can see everything,' " Robbie recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair thought the shorts would go unnoticed in the quiet gym — until they came across Degeneres, de Rossi and the former president.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We then had to do this whole like stretching class, but Tom meanwhile is trying to like, not reveal anything, and he's dying," Robbie said. "The gym instructor keeps saying to Tom, 'Tom, lunge! Lunge!
