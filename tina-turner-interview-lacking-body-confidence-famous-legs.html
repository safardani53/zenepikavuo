She’s an astonishing human being.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1052817726jpg-JS695876557.jpg><p>“We were very fearful of what her impression would be of what we were putting together.</p><p>“She was quite testing about the style of dancing.</p><p>“At rehearsals she showed us how it was to be done.</p><p>“There was this woman who was nearly 80 and she just danced and danced.</p><p>“Eventually she had to throw her shirt off and call for another from the wardrobe department because she was getting so hot.</p><p>“But it was always really good fun being around her. She worked her way to a very hard-won joy, and that was a real example for all of us.”</p><p>Tina’s star power has been proved by the thousands who have flocked to see the show.</p><p>Phyllida added: “She didn’t really want a musical about her life. I think she felt she had retired peacefully in <a href=#>Switzerland</a>.</p><p>“But she gets letters from thousands of people from all over the world talking about how she has inspired them to survive trials in their lives, so she knows there are millions of people out there for whom a sense of her and being close to her keeps her going.</p><p>“That’s what made her think the show was a good idea.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Sam is back for Euro gig</h2><p>SAM Ryder will return to the Eurovision stage at next month’s final.</p><p>The singer, who came second for the UK last year with Space Man, will perform while <a href=#>Europe</a> votes for their favourite entry in <a href=#>Liverpool</a> on May 13.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/600abb4d-5e42-4895-9bcd-0a41fe5ddf5c.jpg><p>Sam, inset, said: “I can’t wait to be back among the beautiful chaos of it all and to watch the incredible artists perform, while bringing you a special performance of our own.

I never saw it at the time.</p><p>“Now she’s unfollowed me. Ten years.”</p><p>A laughing Ella added: “I love you Cher. I’ve always loved her.”</p><p>I’m sure Cher will forgive you, Ella.
