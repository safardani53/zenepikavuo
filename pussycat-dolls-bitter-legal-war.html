Paying customers are expected to receive a refund because of the stalemate between Nicole and Robin, who owns the rights to the group.</p><p>It also means planned new music, which Nicole spent time working on last year, will not be released by the group.</p><p>The singer, who is dating former Scotland rugby player Thom Evans, 36, had been due to bank the biggest amount from the reunion.</p><p>Legal documents show she stood to take a 32.5 per cent share of the net profits from the tour.</p><p>Founder Robin, along with Dolls Ashley, Jessica and Kimberly, would each have received 12.5 per cent of the takings.</p><p>Final member Carmit, who returned despite quitting the group in 2008, before their second album, was in line to bank five per cent.</p><p>Robin founded the Pussycat Dolls as a burlesque troupe in 1995.</p><p>They evolved into a pop group almost a decade later. They burst into the charts in 2005, with debut single Don’t Cha going straight to No1. It stayed for three weeks.</p><p>They have since scored eight Top Ten hits, sold more than 55million records worldwide and collaborated with the likes of Will.i.am, Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.</p><p>Their success also helped launch Nicole’s solo career, which has seen her have a string of hit singles, star in the musical Cats on the West End, bank millions as a judge on shows including The X Factor and The Masked Singer USA and voice a character in 2016 Disney movie Moana.</p><p>Since their split, other members of the band have told about the difficult conditions they were made to work under.</p><h2>‘I SPENT TIME WITH A THERAPIST'</h2><p>In a new interview, Kimberly says that aside from Nicole, the Dolls were made to feel “replaceable” by Robin and label boss Jimmy Iovine, meaning they were constantly struggling for their place in the group.</p><p>She says: “Pussycat Dolls was never meant to be, for us as individuals, a for ever gig.</p><p>“We were always told we were all pretty much replaceable, except for Nicole. Nicole knew she was solid, she was all right, she was safe. The rest of us, not so much. I was fighting for that gig the entire time I was in it. It’s not a very positive environment to work in.</p><p>“But it’s part of the deal, it’s what we signed up for and they wanted it to be a brand that would consistently make money.</p><p>“So doing those hours upon hours of dancing for videos and getting the bruises and giving it your all, then you get the edit back and maybe you’re in it for five or ten seconds because, ultimately, they wanted it to keep going and the more they put the focus on Nicole, the more replaceable they could make us.</p><p>“Then they could just take the brand for ever and ever and keep rolling them out. It didn’t end up happening that way, but that’s what we knew we were in for.”</p><p>Melody Thornton, a member of the group until they split in 2009, clashed with Nicole over the lead vocals and decided not to return for the reunion.</p><p>She previously said being part of the Dolls was so tough that she needed therapy.</p><p>We were always told we were all pretty much replaceable, except for Nicole.</p><span class=quote-credit>Kimberly Wyatt</span><p>Melody added: “I was introduced via this really huge vehicle, the Pussycat Dolls. No one knew it was going to be as successful as it was.</p><p>“Just no anonymity. You kind of lose track of yourself a little bit. Yeah, I spent time with a therapist and it’s been really good.</p><p>“They said, ‘We’re going to have Nicole do all of the recording, you’re going to have to learn and dance with the rest of these girls.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“For me, it really affected my confidence because I wasn’t using my best asset, and people were getting to know me for something that I didn’t do.”</p><p>After more than two decades of fame and fall-outs, it seems the Dolls have finally reached their end.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Music</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/f0720626-1277-4cbb-9558-f0f115827c3f.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000004127791-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000545123087.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>The Pussycat Dolls are back for the first time in 11 years with new single React</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrZmaFeH%2BPaKeuq6OusKLAjJ2mpaSjYq%2BqwNOeqWaklZyurXnWmqlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpussycat-dolls-bitter-legal-war.html&text=The%20Pussycat%20Dolls%20in%20bitter%20legal%20war%20after%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20demanded%2075%25%20of%20their%20earnings%20-%20and&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpussycat-dolls-bitter-legal-war.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpussycat-dolls-bitter-legal-war.html&title=The%20Pussycat%20Dolls%20in%20bitter%20legal%20war%20after%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20demanded%2075%25%20of%20their%20earnings%20-%20and" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpussycat-dolls-bitter-legal-war.html&title=The%20Pussycat%20Dolls%20in%20bitter%20legal%20war%20after%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20demanded%2075%25%20of%20their%20earnings%20-%20and" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpussycat-dolls-bitter-legal-war.html&title=The%20Pussycat%20Dolls%20in%20bitter%20legal%20war%20after%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20demanded%2075%25%20of%20their%20earnings%20-%20and" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpussycat-dolls-bitter-legal-war.html&description=The%20Pussycat%20Dolls%20in%20bitter%20legal%20war%20after%20Nicole%20Scherzinger%20demanded%2075%25%20of%20their%20earnings%20-%20and" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bobbi-althoff-industry-plant-trending.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is 'Bobbi Althoff industry plant' trending?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./marquez-valdes-scantling.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marquez Valdes-Scantling">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
