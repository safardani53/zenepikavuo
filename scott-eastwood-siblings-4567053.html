In her 30s, Laurie became interested in finding out who her biological parents were, and she later<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> found out through paperwork</a> that she was the Million Dollar Baby<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>director’s daughter</a>.</p><h2><span><span><i>Kimber Eastwood</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/kimberlynn-eastwood-and-siblings-shutterstock.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Clint’s second daughter <strong>Kimber, </strong>57, was born from an affair with stuntwoman&nbsp;<strong>Roxane Tunis,&nbsp;</strong>91, in 1964. Like her younger brother, Kimber has gotten into the film industry, taking on a few roles in video shorts as well as producing a handful of TV shows and movies. While her jobs in the movies have varied, most of the jobs listed on her<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IMDb page</a> are for working in the makeup department on various movies. While she’s done makeup for countless episodes of the reality series&nbsp;Dog The Bounty Hunter&nbsp;and the game show&nbsp;Wheel Of Fortune, Kimber has also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>worked with her dad</a>, doing makeup for his 2018 picture&nbsp;The Mule.</p><h2><span><span><i>Kyle Eastwood</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/kyle-eastwood-and-siblings-shutterstock.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Scott’s oldest brother&nbsp;<strong>Kyle,&nbsp;</strong>53, was the first child that Clint had with Maggie Johnson. Kyle also has a career in entertainment, which led him to movies and collaborations with his father, albeit in a very different way than Scott. Kyle is a jazz musician, who scored his dad’s 2008 flick&nbsp;Gran Torino. The actor’s eldest son has also composed music for documentaries by other filmmakers like Homme Less and&nbsp;To The Moon And Back. He’s also taken on a few more music department job’s for his dad’s films like&nbsp;Million Dollar Baby, via<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> IMDb.</a></p><h2><span><span><i>Alison Eastwood</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/alison-eastwood-and-siblings-shutterstock.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>After Kyle, Maggie gave birth to her daughter&nbsp;<strong>Alison,&nbsp;</strong>49, in 1972. Similar to Scott, Alison became an actress, and many of her early roles in movies like&nbsp;Absolute Power&nbsp;and&nbsp;Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil&nbsp;were parts that her father directed. While she’s ventured out to other roles, she did star in her dad’s 2018 film&nbsp;The Mule&nbsp;alongside him, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Besides acting, Alison’s other major passion is animals and she opened <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Eastwood Ranch</a>, which assists with animal welfare, as well as adoption and fostering. She occasionally takes to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her Instagram</a> to show off some of the adorable pets who have been adopted.</p><h2><span><span><i>Kathryn Eastwood</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/kathryn-eastwood-and-siblings-shutterstock.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Scott’s younger sister&nbsp;<strong>Kathryn,&nbsp;</strong>33, is the only sibling he shares his mother Jaclyn Reeve with.

Not much is known about Kathryn, as she’s mostly avoided the limelight, but she has taken on a few acting roles, mostly in short films, per her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb page</a>. She did have a part in her father’s 2014 musical&nbsp;Jersey Boys,&nbsp;where she played the character Tommy’s girlfriend.</p><h2><span><span><i>Francesca Eastwood</i></span></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/francesca-eastwood-and-siblings-shutterstock.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Francesca,&nbsp;</strong>28, was born out of her father’s relationship with actress&nbsp;<strong>Frances Fisher,&nbsp;</strong>69, from 1990 to 1995.
