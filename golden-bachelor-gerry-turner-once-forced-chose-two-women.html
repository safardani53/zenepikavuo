You got to pick out one or the other.’ He picked Toni.”</p><p>When Toni unexpectedly died in 2017, Gerry reconnected with the woman he turned down.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Golden Bachelor">Read more on Golden Bachelor</h2><p>Everett claimed: “After Toni passed away, he dated this girl. They would go to lunch. She lives in another state. It was nothing serious. He just dated her.”</p><p>Gerry’s proud father continued of his son joining the show: “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing. He was very successful in his career. Might as well do something like this. We are supportive of the show. I support him.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m not nervous about my son at all. I know he’ll do a good job no matter what he does. He hasn’t failed at anything.”</p><p>When asked what kind of woman he would like to see for his son, he said: “A partner so to speak. She has to be a good cook. He makes the best prime rib!”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Everett even gave his son advice, as he told him: “Have fun and be careful!”</p><h2>BACHELOR</h2><p>Gerry <a href=#>dated multiple women before joining the show</a>, but was unable to find love again.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerry’s good friend Heather Lanning, who works at The Shady Nook next to his Indiana lakehouse, previously told The U.S. Sun: “He dated a couple of women. They weren’t long-term, but they weren't short-term either.&nbsp;</p><p>“He was with a couple of women for a decent amount of time, but it just didn’t work out.”</p><p>As for why the relationships failed, Heather explained: “I think it goes back to whether you’re there for the right reason or not.”</p><p>Heather insisted Gerry “wasn’t on the dating apps,” but was “introduced by other people” or met the women while at The Shady Nook.&nbsp;</p><h2>FAMILY FIRST</h2><p>Everett previously told The U.S. Sun that his <a href=#>son plans to stay close to his beloved family</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “He likes Indiana. The house on the lake he bought for his two kids, so it’s probably where he wants to say.”</p><p>Gerry’s stepmom, Norma, added: “I don’t think he would move.”</p><p>Gerry&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased his lake home in June 2020 for $375,000</a>.</p><p>The four-bedroom, four-bathroom house, which is valued at $637,700, overlooks Big Long Lake.&nbsp;</p><p>Gerry’s father, stepmother Norma and daughter Jennifer live close by, while his other child, Angela, resides in Illinois.&nbsp;</p><p>But Heather believes that for the right woman, he would make the move.&nbsp;</p><p>She told The U.S. Sun: “I think he would move or have the woman move here. That’s all going to be based upon however that goes down.</p><p>"I don’t think he would be limited to moving.”</p><h2>SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE</h2><p>Gerry's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wife Toni</a>, with whom he shares two daughters, died&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2017</a>.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retired restaurateur</a>&nbsp;explained the <a href=#>lakehouse was their dream</a>.</p><p>He said in a preview clip: "We had 43 wonderful years together. We had two daughters, and I now have two granddaughters.</p><p>"We had a typical but beautiful life full of love, full of activity and as years went on, I retired. We had a plan and we had a plan of what our dream house was going to be.</p><p>"So when Toni retired at the end of May in 2017, we bought that dream house. Closed on it on June 6. From June 6 on, it didn't go according to plan at all. You know, she became ill and her situation got worse over a couple of weeks."</p><p>He then&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">broke down in tears</a>&nbsp;as he said: "So, we went to the emergency room and she had a bacterial infection that infected her kidneys and infected her liver. So I took my wife to the emergency room on July 7 and she passed away on July 15.</p><p>"Every time I look at that lake, I go, 'This is her dream. This is what she deserves. Why am I standing here alone?' It will be six years since she passed away. No one is ever going to replace Toni."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The <a href=#>season premiere of The&nbsp;Golden Bachelor</a>&nbsp;kicked off on September 28.</p><p>The Golden Bachelor airs on Thursdays at 8/7c on ABC.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/golden-bachelor-star-gerry-turner-846997971-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/first-time-bachelor-franchise-history-850263596-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/susan-anna-kathy-patty-peggy-850263597-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxY2aAd4OQaJ6opJSau26uwJyfnqSfp3qosdGrsGaspae7pr6MqKWcnV2bvLOvxJ1knKCfqLJuwNaoZLCnnZq7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgolden-bachelor-gerry-turner-once-forced-chose-two-women.html&text=Golden%20Bachelor%27s%20Gerry%20Turner%20was%20once%20forced%20to%20choose%20between%20two%20women%20years%20before%20joining%20show&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgolden-bachelor-gerry-turner-once-forced-chose-two-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgolden-bachelor-gerry-turner-once-forced-chose-two-women.html&title=Golden%20Bachelor%27s%20Gerry%20Turner%20was%20once%20forced%20to%20choose%20between%20two%20women%20years%20before%20joining%20show" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgolden-bachelor-gerry-turner-once-forced-chose-two-women.html&title=Golden%20Bachelor%27s%20Gerry%20Turner%20was%20once%20forced%20to%20choose%20between%20two%20women%20years%20before%20joining%20show" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgolden-bachelor-gerry-turner-once-forced-chose-two-women.html&title=Golden%20Bachelor%27s%20Gerry%20Turner%20was%20once%20forced%20to%20choose%20between%20two%20women%20years%20before%20joining%20show" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgolden-bachelor-gerry-turner-once-forced-chose-two-women.html&description=Golden%20Bachelor%27s%20Gerry%20Turner%20was%20once%20forced%20to%20choose%20between%20two%20women%20years%20before%20joining%20show" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./louise-fletcher.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Louise Fletcher">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bill-whittle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bill Whittle">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
