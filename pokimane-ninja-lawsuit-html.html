The <a href=# rel=follow>ban was not lifted</a>, just so you know.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That was the last anyone had heard from Ninja on the matter until he said in a now-deleted tweet that "All will be explained," hinting that the supposed feud between arguably the two biggest streamers on Twitch would be sorted out.&nbsp;</p><p>But then, <a href=# rel=follow>nothing came of Ninja's premonition</a>. A day later, Pokimane clapped back, saying,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I thought it was kind of interesting that Ninja was like, 'Everything will be clarified.' And then he woke up the next day and played Fortnite for 7 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>From her vantage point, she believed that Ninja and JiDion shared much of the same viewership, and flipping sides at this point would mean that Ninja would lose viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ninja Lied to JiDion's Fans</h2><p>In response to Pokimane calling out Ninja, she got a <a href=# rel=follow>DM from his wife</a>, Jessica. Jessica&nbsp;explicitly stated that Ninja had lied to get out of a tricky situation.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Ninja had clearly said that he had sent a text to his representative at Twitch to pull on some strings to get JiDion back on board.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Turns out, Ninja never sent that text and simply lied to stop the harassment he'd been receiving from JiDion's fans.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Pokimane leaked Jessica Blevin's DM </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Moreover, Jessica claimed that Pokimane was well aware of what had happened and was garnering hate and defaming her husband's good name.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jessica accused Pokimane of "actively bringing harassment" to Ninja and herself "at the highest level.&nbsp;</p><p>To top it all off, Jessica said that Team Ninja was considering everything an act of defamation of character and very seriously so. She added that a lawsuit was on the table and&nbsp;the legal team would be involved in the matter.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKifoLaurc2eZKehnp%2BubrjAsKquoaRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpokimane-ninja-lawsuit-html.html&text=Pokimane%20Wants%20Ninjas%20Apology%20after%20His%20Dead%20Lawsuit%20over%20JiDion%20Drama&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpokimane-ninja-lawsuit-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpokimane-ninja-lawsuit-html.html&title=Pokimane%20Wants%20Ninjas%20Apology%20after%20His%20Dead%20Lawsuit%20over%20JiDion%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpokimane-ninja-lawsuit-html.html&title=Pokimane%20Wants%20Ninjas%20Apology%20after%20His%20Dead%20Lawsuit%20over%20JiDion%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpokimane-ninja-lawsuit-html.html&title=Pokimane%20Wants%20Ninjas%20Apology%20after%20His%20Dead%20Lawsuit%20over%20JiDion%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpokimane-ninja-lawsuit-html.html&description=Pokimane%20Wants%20Ninjas%20Apology%20after%20His%20Dead%20Lawsuit%20over%20JiDion%20Drama" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tony-bennett-lady-gaga-lasting-collaborative-friendship-everything-to-know-7563930.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga's Lasting Friendship Was Filled with 'Love'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./inside-abandoned-stadium-swansea-city-vetch-field-liberty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside abandoned stadium left as a park with centre circle still intact and players entrance stil">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
