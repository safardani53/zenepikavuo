The couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>welcomed their first child</a> together, son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Phoenix</a>, via surrogate on Jan. 16, 2023. Less than a year later, they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>expanded their family</a> in November 2023 with a daughter named London.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After welcoming her son, Hilton opened up to PEOPLE in October 2023 about the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>most surprising part of motherhood</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It's just how much love I could have for someone,” she said. “I thought I knew what love was with my husband, but as soon as I met my baby, it's just this love on another level. He has just changed my life in every way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Paris in Love star also spoke with PEOPLE about how she’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>learned the power of “saying no”</a> since becoming a mother. Hilton wears many hats as a businesswoman, DJ, author and more, which she said are "definitely a lot to balance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm constantly saying no to things, because I just want to spend as much time with him as possible, and I just don't want to miss any of these special moments in his life and all these milestones," she said. "He's my everything, so I always put him first.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From their secret births to the meaning behind their names, here’s everything to know about Paris Hilton’s kids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-phoenix-barron-hilton-reum></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Phoenix Barron Hilton Reum</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Paris Hilton and her son Phoenix.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paris Hilton Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hilton and Reum welcomed their son Phoenix via surrogate on Jan. 16, 2023. "It's always been my dream to be a mother and I'm so happy that Carter and I found each other," the new mom told PEOPLE. "We are so excited to start our family together and our hearts are exploding with love for our baby boy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the season 2 premiere of Paris in Love, Hilton opened up about her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>decision to use a surrogate</a>. "Surrogacy was a difficult decision to make," she said. "I would have loved that experience of growing the baby in your tummy and feeling the kicks and all of those exciting moments, but my life has just been so public. So even though the baby is biologically mine and Carter's, we decided to have a surrogate carry him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The reality star has also discussed the role her past trauma played in her choice. Hilton told Glamour UK in February 2023 that the sexual abuse she experienced as a teenager at Utah boarding school Provo Canyon School <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>left her afraid of the medical exams</a> that go along with pregnancy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm just so scared. I think, again, leading back to Provo of even being in a doctor's office, just all of that. The shots, the IVs that they put in," she shared. "But I want a family so bad, it's just the physical part of doing it. I'm just so scared ... childbirth and death are the two things that scare me more than anything in the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an effort to keep her son’s birth a secret, Hilton <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wore a disguise to the hospital</a> and didn’t tell anyone about his arrival — including her family. In the season 2 trailer of Paris in Love, the reality star explained that “if anyone found out, it would be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>paparazzi all over Cedars</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've given my whole life to everyone for so long. It's just been really important to me to keep this a secret," she said. "This is the first time that something's just mine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hilton waited until a week after Phoenix’s birth to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>share the news with her friends and family.</a> “Not even my mom, my sisters, my best friend knew until he was over a week old,” she revealed on her podcast I Am Paris in February 2023. “It was really nice to have that with Carter, be our own journey together. I just feel like my life has been so public, and I've never really had anything be just mine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hilton added, “When I introduced my mom to our baby boy, it was amazing to see the look on her face. She was so surprised — just the look on her face, it was priceless."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The media personality also opened up on her podcast about how <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she decided on her son's name 10 years ago</a>. "Phoenix has a few good pop culture reference points, but more importantly it's the bird that flames out and then rises from the ashes to fly again," she said. "I want my son to grow up knowing that disaster and triumph go around and come around throughout our lives. And that this should give us great hope for the future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for his middle name, Hilton explained that the moniker is a tribute to her late grandfather, Barron Hilton. “He was always my mentor. I looked up to my grandfather so much, and we were so close, and I miss him every day. So, I really wanted to honor him by having his name in my first son's name,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July 2023, Hilton <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated Phoenix’s 6-month birthday</a> by sharing a carousel of new photos, including a shot of her son cuddling in her lap. “My baby boy Phoenix is 6 months old today.🥰 He is my world and makes my life feel so complete.🥹,” she captioned the post. “Can't wait for all the magical memories we will create together!💫 Mommy loves you so much angel baby😇.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the time Phoenix was 6 months old, Hilton shared with PEOPLE that her son was already “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>really great with flying on the plane</a>” and a “good traveler.” She added that she "can't wait until he's a little bigger so I'm able to take him everywhere ... I just can't wait for Hawaii, because I can't wait to have him be with all of his cousins."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As he’s grown, his parents agree that Phoenix <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>closely resembles the reality star</a>. "I saw his eyes the other day and having looked into your eyes so many times, I kind of got chills because that's Paris' eyes," Reum shared in an April 2023 episode of I Am Paris. Hilton added, "His baby photos look exactly like mine."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Paris Hilton and her son Phoenix.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Paris Hilton Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In October 2023, after several followers <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>left hurtful comments</a> about the size of Phoenix’s head on one of Hilton’s photos, she replied that her "angel is perfectly healthy" and "just has a large brain." She later issued a statement about the “unacceptable” comments that “deeply” hurt her.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If I don't post my baby, people assume I'm not a great mother and if I do post him, there are some people who are cruel and hateful I'm a proud working mom and my baby is perfectly healthy, adorable and angelic,” she said. “I've dreamt of being a mom for as long as I can remember ... Every day with him is a reminder of what truly matters.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Hilton commemorated Phoenix’s first Halloween <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>with several family costumes</a>. She dressed up her baby boy as a pilot to match her recreation of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Britney Spears</a>’ outfit from the 2003 “Toxic” music video and a mushroom to complete her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Katy Perry</a> costume that channeled one of the pop star’s looks from her Las Vegas residency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I cannot wait to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dress him up in these costumes</a>, it's going to be so cute. I'm focusing on making it a special thing for our little baby boy,” Hilton told PEOPLE of her Halloween plans. "And I'm excited to do family costumes as well, so I've been trying to think of cute family ideas so that Carter, Phoenix and I could dress up together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the GQ Men of the Year Awards in November 2023, Hilton opened up to PEOPLE about her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>special bond with her firstborn</a>. “It's exciting to have this next phase in my life and just to have this little angel who just brightens up my day every morning and this smile melts my heart,” she said. “He's my best buddy and I just am obsessed.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also shared that Phoenix has mastered his first words. “He says, ‘Mama.’ He says, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘Dada’ too, now,” Hilton said. “I felt like the other day when I said, ‘I love you, bey.’ He said something back to me and it sounded like, ‘I love you.'

While the Paris in Love star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>considered telling her mom</a> about expecting London, she ultimately surprised her family on Thanksgiving by walking into her living room holding the newborn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Live with Kelly and Mark</a> in November 2023, Hilton opened up about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>revealing the baby news</a> to her family.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was before the turkey.
